 unknown_generic:0 "The world is wide, and much of it lies beyond the understanding or concern of those bound to their own corners of it. Though maps may show distant shores and whispered lands, such places are far removed from the reach of lords and kings, and further still from the affairs that shape the known realms. What lies beyond is not ours to know. The focus remains on what is near, what can be ruled and recorded. All else, for now, lies beyond the edges of relevance, untouched and unheeded."

 wilderness_generic:0 "Across the world lie many unclaimed lands, from frozen tundras to sweltering jungles, from vast grasslands to deep and shadowed forests. Some were once part of great realms, now reclaimed by nature's grasp after centuries of neglect. Others are so harsh and unforgiving that no ruler has ever truly claimed them. Many conceal hidden dangers, strange creatures, or long-forgotten secrets.\n\nTo claim a wilderness county and begin its settlement, go to the holding view and choose "Colonize". When you own a settlement barony, you can upgrade the main settlement building to start development."
