 agot_rp_event.0020.d:0 "I was a #bold crow#!, becoming Chief was no easy journey."
 agot_rp_event.0020.d.tt:0 "At first, a stranger to the tribe, you were once their bitter enemy when you were a Black Brother. Still, through grit and knowledge from your life in the South, the tribe came to view you as the Chief."
 agot_rp_event.0020.e:0 "I'm a #bold shipwreck survivor#!; the wealth from the cargo let me rise to Chief."
 agot_rp_event.0020.e.tt:0 "Piracy, trade, or another occupation involving the Sea. You found yourself shipwrecked. Thanks to the goods in your ship's hold, you were able to establish yourself as Chief of a tribe."
