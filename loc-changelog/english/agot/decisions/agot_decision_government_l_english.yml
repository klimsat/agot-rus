 agot_adopt_kneeler_ways_decision_desc:0 "Life in the cruel wasteland of the Far North has made us into ruthless and unyielding folk, very different from those living on the other side of the Wall.

They clearly know how to make the most of this pleasant land and if their laws help them in this, then we shall adopt them as well."
