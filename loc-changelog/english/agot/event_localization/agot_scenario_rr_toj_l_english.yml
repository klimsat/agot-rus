The grip on my sword tightens, my resolve hardens. Facing an enemy I can not hope to defeat.\n\nI lay strewn across the hard sandstone, pain encompassing my being.

There are yet more decisions to be made, yet more work to be done.\n\nThe bodies of three knights of the Kingsguard still lie dead where we left them, their lifeblood mingling with the red dirt of Dorne. They were enemies, but honorable men, deserving of a better fate than to become food for the crows. We use stones from the tower to erect cairns for them. It is the best we can do.\n\nWhen at last we are done, I sit beside Ser Arthur Dayne's cairn and lay the great knight's sword across my lap. Dawn, it is called. Some would call it the most priceless blade in all of Westeros. None would deny that it is the most beautiful. For millennia it has been passed down the Dayne line, not to the head of the house, but only to the swordsmen most deserving of it. Ser Arthur would have wanted it returned to Starfall and bestowed upon the next Sword of the Morning."

Instead, there is only a single woman.\n\nShe wears a gown of deep purple to match the colors of House Dayne, but the violet of her eyes is more vivid still. This can only be Ashara, brother to the Sword of the Morning. She sees Dawn in my hands, understands what it must mean that I bear this sword to Starfall, yet still asks the question that has been haunting her.\n\n\"My brother?\"\n\nI can only shake my head and offer her the sword. Her brave facade cracks when she takes Dawn into her hands, tears that she had long held back finally flowing. I would have given much to avoid laying yet another tragedy at the feet of this woman, but there was no other way."
