 agot_filler_war.201.t:0 "Down the Slopes of Death"
 agot_filler_war.201.desc:0 "Fields of flames greets my eye, as my knights' horns sound the charge.. I smell the fear and pain of dying men in agony, friend and foe. It could drive a man insane. But on the field waits my fate, and may it be foretold from ancient times... in a clear hill it stands, a beast with sharp iron teeth, and hateful burning eyes."
 agot_filler_war.201.a:0 "I know now what is to come. It's no use, to try and run... What is to be.. "

 agot_filler_war.202.desc:0 "What is to be, let it be done! My opponent lies dead at my feet. As my sight pans over the battlefield, I see the enemy has started to rout in their flank. My actions won the day, and songs will be sung of how the last [GetPlayer.GetDynasty.GetBaseName] led his men in a fearless charge to victory."
 agot_filler_war.202.a:0 "Seek out a bard troupe for me. Let them spread word of my heroics today."

 agot_filler_war.300.t:0 "The Folly of Broken Men"
 agot_filler_war.300.desc:0 "At the wake of the battle's end, some of my men desecrated a nearby village. There's nothing to do for the poor inhabitants - my men were shaken and disturbed by war and cared not for the lives of the peasants. At least they were put to the sword in the end. Saved them from a lifetime of dwelling on past horrors committed upon them by your men."
 agot_filler_war.300.a:0 "Hang those who raped and pillaged - we are all prisoners to war's hell, it does not give us license to act like common bandits."

 agot_filler_war.400.desc:0 "The fighting has been thick in the Riverlands, as it always is when war rages. While riding through a pillaged hamlet our column broaches the crest of a hill, and gruesome sight twists into view. A gnarled tree with naked branches jutting from its crown. Dangling from these cruel fingers are corpses of this village's populace, swaying in the breeze like abandoned marionettes.\n\nThe grim atmosphere is pierced by a shrill cry. I spur my horse, and gallop to the foot of the tree, where I discover the source of the wailing. The babe looks up at me, swaddled in muck and gore. His mother, grasped by the noose mere feet above him, bloats. How could it have possibly survived?\n'Leave it, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]' speaks [soldier.GetFullName]. 'It is a bad omen. Better a feast for the crows.'"
 agot_filler_war.400.a:0 "We can't leave the child out here."
 agot_filler_war.400.b:0 "It is common for men at war to return with bastards..."
 agot_filler_war.400.c:0 "Leave it here, this is a poor omen."
