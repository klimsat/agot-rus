 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.t:0 "The Big Storm"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.desc:0 "#S CRASH#! The thunder booms and the lightning cracks outside my fortress. A thousand footsteps of rain dances across the walls and roof, deafening all of us trapped inside. The wind relentlessly slams into the walls, desperately finding a way to get inside...\n\nA major storm has blown in from the warm waters in the Summer Sea and is now passing over my island abode, punishing us with a wrath comparable to the Storm God of old. Fortunately, my wooden fortress is keeping me and those I find valuable safe. I've made it very clear before this storm that this fortress is only for those I value, from my servants to my family and even my courtiers. Yet, I am being enraged by the moans and pleas of some of the island's folk — slaves, pirates, and sailors. They all want shelter, in #italic my#! fort!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.a:0 "The storm is worse than I thought; let them in."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.a.tt.a:0 "#X You allow the people to take shelter in your fortress, although there is always a chance at danger when you let strangers in.#!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.a.tt.b:0 "#italic Something bad happens#!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0001.b:0 "Like I said, my fort, my rules."

  #  WANDERING THROUGH OLD BATTLEFIELD #
  ######################################

 agot_filler_stepstones.0002.t:0 "Old Battlefield"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0002.desc:0 "While traveling across my domain, we pitched camp at what first seemed like a completely ordinary and boring field. Grassy, empty, and even a little stony.\n\nWhile I'm walking around my foot strikes something in the topsoil...a sword hilt! I pull it out of the dirt and see that it's ancient. As I walk around more, I encounter more and more broken artifacts all over the field: a broken Ironborn axe, a Tyroshi dagger hilt, even what appears to be a Summer Islander's bow!\n\nAll of these artifacts are broken, but it does remind me that the Stepstones have been host to many a great battles over time."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0002.a:0 "Sometimes I forget that these islands are watered with blood."

  # STORM WASHES ARTIFACTS ASHORE #

 agot_filler_stepstones.0003.t:0 "Storm Washes Artifacts "
 agot_filler_stepstones.0003.desc:0 "A minor storm system has recently passed over [stepstones_holding.GetName]. While minor, the storm still sunk a few trading cogs off port. As a result, a number of items from these cogs are washing ashore: dead bodies; weapons; trade goods; and most exciting, chests full of gold!\n\nWhile walking along one of the beaches on [stepstones_holding.GetName], I happen to come across some one of these chests that were washed ashore. It seems the smallfolk in the area have not yet spotted this trove of loot...Perhaps I can — discreetly — inspect the cargo..."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0003.a:0 "Jackpot!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0003.b:0 "I would not stoop so low."

 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.t:0 "Stepstones Ravaged by Storms"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.desc:0 "A number of reports have come to me concerning my demense in the Stepstones.\n\nApparently, [ravaged_stepstones_holding.GetName] has been utterly ravaged by a massive storm system. I am told that most of the wooden structures and ramshackle shacks on the island have been severely damaged, if not outright destroyed.\n\nThe people of [ravaged_stepstones_holding.GetName] are also suffering as a result of this storm system. Many are dead, and in the ensuing chaos following the storm, many are dying. Disease is running rampant, people are starving, and worst of all, my authority is not being enforced."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.a:0 "I'm sure those shacks will be #italic so#! hard to replace..."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.b.standard:0 "I will, uh, pray for them."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.b.religious:0 "I will pray for them."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0004.c:0 "I will send relief to the inhabitants of the island."

 agot_filler_stepstones.0005.desc:0 ""And then, I #EMP sliced #!my cutlass across the Braavosi imp's throat," the aged Ironborn reaver tells me, ale running down his scarred and flabby chin. While out for a drink at an inn on [stepstonesfiller_location0005.GetName], this old Ironborn reaver has been recounting tales of his exploits to me. Apparently, back in his youth, he was quite a hotshot reaver.\n\nAs we drink more and more, the reaver's drunken merriness turns to gloom and doom. He looks me in the eyes, and drunkenly blurts out, "But those days are long gone. They call me a drunken squid...A man with no purpose! Bah!" and without missing a heartbeat, he goes back to his crazy stories."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0005.a:0 "That's all your good for now, old squid, stories!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0005.b:0 "I could use a new bodyguard..."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0005.c:0 "Haha, I know a #italic job#! for you..."

  # SUMMER ISLAND SHIP FIGHTING IRONBORN NERDS #

 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.t:0 "The Squid and the Swan"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.desc:0 ""#EMP HARRRRRRRRRK!#!" I hear some men outside my wooden fortress shouting. The sun is barely up, which means these men must be the guards responsible for watching the water ways off the coast of my island, [stepstonesfiller_location0006.GetName].\n\nI hastily get dressed and storm out, where one of the guards meets me in the field. He is shouting something about Ironborn reavers fighting against a passing Summer Island swan ship!\n\nI rush out to a makeshift tower, climbing the oak stained stairs two at a time, and see the ships what must be inches apart. I can make out the Summer Islander arrows darting into the Ironborn, and I can hear the sadistic war cries of the reavers all the way from here..."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.a:0 "What are we waiting for? Attack both!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.a.tt_success:0 "You wreak havoc on both ships, successfully looting from both during the chaos"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.a.tt_success_title:0 "Successful Attack!"
 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.a.tt_failure:0 "You have difficulty fighting the crew of both ships. Even worse, your own ships got banged up in the process"

 agot_filler_stepstones.0006.d:0 "Let them fight, we will need our strength."

 agot_filler_stepstones.0007.desc:0 "A Great Ship bearing the colors of the Summer Islands has docked at [location.GetName], and the captain has come to me with a proposition. Among great stories of his travels, he is on a mission to create a great new trade route and that he wishes to trade some of his product with me, bringing a number of exotic goods from his homeland on the back of his ship. He has a parrot, a monkey, and a number of other exotic animals, as well as a number of rare spices and dyes.\n\nHe is willing to trade these goods for a number of things, including gold. The parrot squawks a sound in my direction "More gold, less squawk!" The captain awaits for my answer."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0007.a:0 "I will take the parrot, and nothing else."
 agot_filler_stepstones.0007.b:0 "May I try some spices?"
