The Stormlands, however, true to their name, never allow calm skies or seas to rest easy for long. \n\nIt starts as just a drizzle, but soon enough, the skies have opened completely, the winds howl through the valley as strong as those from the tales of Durran Godsgrief. Unfortunately for me, it would seem my Storm's End for the day will be a dilapidated old farmstead I spotted on a ridge a few hundred yards away."

Some old firewood sat by the hearth, and thankfully, I managed to get it lit, providing me some small comfort as the afternoon turned to evening. As the gloaming of dusk set in, however, I heard the drum of hooves on the ground cutting through the sound of rain lashing at the leaky roof. \n\nI stand up to peek out the window at the party of vagabonds who have ridden up outside, the lot of them eyeing up my palfrey with malicious intent. They're the sort I can tell are bandits from a mile away, clearly having not seen the comfort of a warm bed in many months.\n\nAs they draw closer, I decide it best to make the first move, walking up to the door and opening it, as the party's leader stands just feet away from me.

None of them bothered me, thank the Gods, but watching the lot of them talking away to each other in the most base, guttural tongue and drink skins of rancid wine dry didn't exactly make for a pleasant evening. Needless to say, sleeping around a band of cutthroats to make the time pass faster wasn't much of an option.\n\nWhen daylight broke, though, the storm did likewise; it seems for now the skies had nothing more to empty out onto your lands.

No councillors to bother me about what petitions they'd been brought, no lickspittles or sycophants looking to seek my favour.

The inside smelled of damp and rot, the sparse furniture of whatever peasant had inhabited it crawling with woodlice. The abandonment took place hastily, by the looks of it; the inhabitants were chased off by war, most likely.\n\nIn their hurry to leave, though, they'd not taken all of their valuables. Or, more likely, they had hidden them intentionally, hoping to come back to reclaim them. As I walked over to the hearth, one of the floorboards had rotten away to reveal a small strongbox, a few gold dragons and four-score silver stags contained within."

A mule sat idly, tied to one of the few remaining fence posts outside, though thankfully, another remained for me to tie my palfrey to. The mule's saddle was fairly plain aside from a seven-pointed star sewn onto its left side.\n\nThe door creaked open, and a stick-thin old man stood in its place — a traveling Septon, wearing billowing white robes and a crystal about his neck. He graciously beckoned me inside and sat talking to me of the faith well into the wee hours of the night, only stopping once daylight broke and the storm eased up."

A pair of horses sat tied to a post outside, a large rouncey and a small Marcher hobby. Both carried a large number of provisions on their backs, with the rouncey also having a shield with unfamiliar heraldry on it.\n\nHaving heard my approach, the man inside opens the door, standing there in a slightly baggy arming jack, hand on the hilt of his sword. He quickly relaxes, though, upon realizing I wasn't a brigand. He invited me inside and revealed himself to be a hedge knight. We sat into the wee hours of the night, discussing tourneys we both had attended and the battles we each had fought in."

Further, when the guards arrived to detain her, she managed to fight off three of them before finally being restrained.\n\nThough a bastard, being of noble blood, he felt the need to get a decision from me regarding what is to be done with her."

"I'll do my best not to roughen you up too badly," I say as another one of my servants presents me with my sword.\n\n"I won't be offering you the same courtesy, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]," she replied, twirling her spear elegantly as the pair of us neared the center of the courtyard."

She lands a few good jabs with that spear and takes great pains not to allow me to close the distance between us.\n\nEventually, though, I get in close; and up close, that spear of hers is more of a hindrance than a help. I get in five or so good hits in quick succession, and she falls flat on her back.\n\nDuring her fall, she loses her grip on her spear, and it goes flying to the side. Defenseless, she reluctantly yields. I offer her a hand up, but she wordlessly and angrily slaps it away, rising to her feet and marching out of the courtyard, not even stopping to grab her spear."

 agot_filler_stormlands.0414.t:0 "A Sandstorm of a Woman: Defeat"
 agot_filler_stormlands.0414.desc:0 "The fight is one of the most difficult I'd ever faced; her agility and dexterity are unlike anything I'd seen before. Every time I attempt to close the distance, she either jabs me with her spear to halt me or dodges out of the way and hits me in the side. With the weight of my armor, it is a war of attrition that I am losing.\n\nAt first, I manage to keep up, but after a few minutes, I am exhausted — and at that point, she manages to land a blow right on the back of my knee. I fall to the floor.\n\nReluctantly, I yield. The woman simply nods her head with self-satisfaction, waltzing out of my courtyard to leave me with the shame of my defeat. One of my servants comes over to offer me a hand up, and I grumpily swat it away, rising myself."

He is pursuing a Dornish knight, whom he claims stole the victor's purse from a tourney and, further, that he murdered his squire while escaping.\n\nThe knight believes that the Dornishman is passing through my lands en route to make his crossing over the Red Mountains and back to his homeland. He requests my leave to track down this vagabond."

You find the Dornish knight at a brothel, indulging himself in wine and women, most unlike a man on the run.\n\nHe is shocked when you inform him of the accusations, professing his innocence.

Both had impressed you with their resilience, but they eventually cracked and confessed to you, as all men do. The Dornish knight had indeed stolen the prize of the tourney after he was unhorsed and fled, yet it was not him responsible for the squire's death. The blame for that rested on the hedge knight, who had beaten the poor squire to death in his rage at being unhorsed.\n\nNeither of the pair survived long after their confessions. You decided to keep the remnants of the winner's purse as payment for your hard work."

Within minutes, the mill was nothing more than an enormous torch, burning so bright that I'd not be surprised if it could be seen from atop the Wall. The miller and a few peasants continued battling the blaze past the point of losing the fight, but I ordered my men to set their buckets down."

I rose from my knees, defeated; my men and the peasants set down their buckets as the roof collapsed in. Why would the Gods allow this to happen?"
 agot_filler_stormlands.0447.a:0 "The Gods are fickle, and work in mysterious ways..."
 agot_filler_stormlands.0447.b:0 "I'm starting to think the Gods might not even care..."

 agot_filler_stormlands.0448.desc:0 "The Gods were good! The storm overhead grew even more vigorous, the rain lashing down harder and heavier than before. It was hard not to weep as I rose from my feet and felt that, perhaps for the first time, my prayers had indeed been answered. With the torrential downpour and the pious efforts of my men and the peasants, the fire was soon halted. May grain continue to pass through the mill for many years to come!"
