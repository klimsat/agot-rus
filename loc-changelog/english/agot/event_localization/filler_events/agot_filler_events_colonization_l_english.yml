The air is pungent with a thousand scents of vibrant life and fetid decay.\n\nSuddenly, I see it. Caught in a shaft of light breaking through the canopy like a heavenly spear: a huge deer, ice-white, with amber eyes that fix on me for a moment.\n\nThen, with a snorting exhalation, the white hart springs away down the path.
