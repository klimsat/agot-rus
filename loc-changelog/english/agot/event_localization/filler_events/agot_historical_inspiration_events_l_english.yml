 #The Legacy of The Conqueror
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.t:0 "The Legacy of the Conqueror"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.opening:0 "As I'm reading the latest missives from around the realm, I cast my mind to its origins. The conquest of the Seven Kingdoms remains one of the greatest feats achieved within one lifespan. I cannot help but ponder the impact of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetFirstNamePossessive] Conquest on our realm. The legacy of the [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetHouse.GetName] dynasty is undeniable, and its foundations were drawn from that one man's actions.\n\n"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0001.nontarg:0 "A part of me acknowledges the benefits that have come with Targaryen rule. Stability, centralized power, and the protection of the dragons are not things to be taken lightly. Yet, I also wonder what would have happened had Aegon not crossed from Dragonstone. Would Westeros still be divided to this day? Would a Westerosi have broken the stalemate? Could peace have been achieved without blood and fire?\n\nThe legacy of the Conquest will be debated for centuries to come, but it is for me to decide what I can take away from it."

 #Reflections of Cleverness
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.t:0 "Reflections of Cleverness"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.lannister:0 "I step onto the courtyard and raise a hand to shield my face against the bright sun. The shadow of a Lannister standard flowing in the wind briefly shields my eyes, and a thought comes to my head. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Lannister_29').GetFirstNameNicknamed]. The mythical scion of my [house|E]. Did he truly have the Casterlys out of Casterly Rock devoured by a pride of lions to give us our sigil? The story has many tellings. Did he manipulate the Casterlys into killing each other? Sleep with all their women in the dead of night? Drive them out with rats instead?\n\nWhile the maesters dispute all of these, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, it is a legend that I have been told I am descended from since I was a babe."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.poet:0 "I stare at the blank parchment beneath my quill. The poetry usually comes easy to me, but today I cannot make the words come. I lean back and look to the ceiling, and I wonder how the poets of the past mastered their wit.\n\nMy mind casts the picture of [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Lannister_29').GetFirstNameNicknamed]. While the maesters dispute his existence, saying he is nothing but a figure of myth and legend, there was a man who must have mastered his wit. Though not known to be a poet, tricking the Casterlys out of one of the greatest seats in the land must be one of the most cunning feats committed in Westeros. What could I learn from such a tale?"
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.bastard:0 "I bid goodbye to the minor nobles leaving and I note the squint in their eyes. Bastard. I know it's what they're thinking. The pettiest of lords they are, and yet the stain in my blood makes them regard me as their lesser. In my darker moments I may even believe them...\n\nThe disquieting thought does not leave me even as I lay abed, eyes locked to the dark ceiling. Yet in the darkness, a comforting thought arises. Bastards have achieved greatness before. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Lannister_29').GetFirstNameNicknamed], the mythical founder of House Lannister, is said to have been a bastard in some tellings of the story. What petty lord can claim such a deed, legitimate blood or no? The thought calms my racing mind, and before sleep takes me, I resolve that I shall remember this on the morrow."
 agot_historical_inspiration.0002.desc.bastard_legitimized:0 "I bid goodbye to the minor nobles leaving and I note the squint in their eyes. Bastard. I know it's what they're thinking. Despite it being ostensibly cleared, the circumstances of my birth still stain me, and though the pettiest of lords they are, that stain makes them regard me as their lesser. In my darker moments I may even believe the worst of it...\n\nThe disquieting thought does not leave me even as I lay abed, eyes locked to the dark ceiling.

 #The Last of a Dynasty

 agot_historical_inspiration.0003.desc:0 "I hear my steps echo through the halls of my castle, dimmed only lightly by the plants dotting various windows. No sound of children playing. No rapturous laughter of brothers, no joyous giggling of sisters. Servants part for me as I cross the courtyard, bowing respectfully, yet their presence does not comfort me. I am alone. The last of the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName] dynasty.\n\nMine would not not be the first dynasty to be felled in the Reach. When [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Gardener_95').GetFullNameRegnal] and his sons stood against the dragons in the Field of Fire during [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_27').GetFirstNamePossessive] conquest, that great line was extinguished. Is mine, too, doomed to the pages of history? I wonder now what should I take from that tale, from one dead line to a dying one?"

A smile cannot help but cross my lips as I am read their designs.\n\nOne craftsman replied as requested, with a pair of sapphire eyes that will be sure to charm any I speak to. Another suggests a ruby pair instead, which would certainly look fearsome. An unorthodox suggestion was eyes of amethyst to unnerve those who would seek to do me harm. Finally, one was so bold as to suggest a pair of diamonds, dazzling all with my wealth."
