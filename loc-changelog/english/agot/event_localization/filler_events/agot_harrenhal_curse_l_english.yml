 agot_harrenhal_curse.0002.desc:0 "As I descend one of the spiraling stairs within the Tower of Dread, a misstep sends my heart racing. Miraculously averting the breaking of my neck in the fall, I say a quick prayer to [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName].\n\nRelief floods over me, quickly followed by #italic dread#! as I spot the culprit... a small pool of #N blood#!! A gasp escapes my lips — for in that crimson pool, the specter of #S the Curse of Harrenhal#! seems to stir, triggering memories of unsettling whispers and tales that once clung to the tower's history.\n\nPerhaps the source of this blood is a mere spill of mutton or venison freshly butchered, yet I can't shake the nagging feeling #italic that darker forces are at play within these walls#!."

Upon closer inspection, I discover a hole gnawed into one corner.\n\nIf there's any grain of truth to #S the Curse of Harrenhal#!, it's the whispered belief that the castle was a breeding ground for monstrous rats."

Yet, in these very same walls, the Black Dread proved him wrong — reducing him to nought but ashes, forever sealing his tragic fate into the castle's history, if not the whole of Westeros..."
