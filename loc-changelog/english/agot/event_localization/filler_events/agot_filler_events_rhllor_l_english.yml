 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Light"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.desc:0 "One inauspicious night, I find myself alone in my study, mulling over reports and the details usually left to lesser men. Suddenly, the door creaks open and, without any ceremony, a woman steps inside. She is dressed entirely in red, her hair like fire, and she speaks in a deep, strangely melodic voice. She is unnervingly beautiful, and for a moment I wonder if I have fallen asleep. But when I blink, she is still there.\n\nThe Red Woman tells me of a prophecy, of the Lord of Light, and of a name I recognize from lessons long ago: Azor Ahai, the wielder of Lightbringer, born amidst salt and smoke — the savior of the known world.\n\nShe leans close and whispers in my ear, telling me that the time has come for me to claim my destiny, to fulfill the auguries seen in temples as far away as Asshai. All I need do now is seize it..."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.a:0 "I will listen, but nothing more."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.b:0 "I must heed these signs..."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.b.tt:0 "...for the night is dark and full of terrors."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.c:0 "I must heed these signs...and #italic more#! besides..."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.d:0 "Begone, vile witch! You hold no sway over me!"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.e:0 "Guards! Assassin!"

 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.t:0 "Embracing the Light"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.desc:0 "Having embraced the Lord of Light, my faith burns anew within me, casting its radiant glow upon my name.\n\nTo honor this profound devotion to the Red God, maybe I should consider adopting a new sigil — one that still pays homage to my House while reflecting the fiery essence and sacred flames of the Lord of Light. Shall I seize this chance to let my faith blaze upon my banner, or retain the traditional arms of my House?"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.a:0 "Let the flames of R'hllor guide our banner."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.b:0 "I will keep our traditional arms."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.tt:0 "You gain a personal coat of arms in the fashion of R'hllor"

 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.desc:0 "As we make our way through the bustling streets of [current_location.GetNameNoTooltip], [companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I cannot help but notice the growing din ahead. The roar of the crowd gathered before us grows louder and louder — like a bonfire feasting upon too much kindling.\n\nBefore the crowd stands a red priest of R'hllor delivering a fiery address, leaving the audience in rapt abandon. [red_priest.GetHerHis|U] every word seems to drive listeners into more of a frenzy...\n\n#italic "The night grows dark around us, smothering the light in each of us... The Lord's light, the very flame of our existence, requires sacrifice!"#! [red_priest.GetFirstNamePossessive] booming voice cuts through the air as [red_priest.GetHerHis] eyes lock with mine own. "Ho! What do #italic we#! have #italic here#!? A mighty [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l] come to mingle with the commoners."\n\nThe sudden silence presses around us like a candle's flame snuffed out between two fingers, but my gaze remains locked on [red_priest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. "What would you give to the Lord of Light, to see his #italic true#! face?" #italic [red_priest.GetHerHis] eyes drift toward a lit pyre next to [red_priest.GetHerHim].#!"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.a:0 "Only a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]'s blood will do."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.b:0 "Surely the Lord of Light would accept [companion.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.c:0 "I think it's time to get out of [current_location.GetNameNoTooltip]"
