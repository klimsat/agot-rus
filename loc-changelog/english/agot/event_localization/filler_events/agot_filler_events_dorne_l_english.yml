 agot_filler_dorne.0001.desc:0 "Two highborn lads have come to me asking me to solve a dispute they are having. Apparently, they both took the same woman for a paramour. To make matters worse, they think that a duel could settle this dispute; they #italic just#! want my opinion on whether they should duel or not.\n\nLooking at her, I can see why the two are ready to come to blows — she is simply beautiful..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.a:0 "Oh, to live and love. Let them fight it out."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.a_tt:0 "You encourage the noblemen to duel over her."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.b:0 "No, this woman is not worth noble blood."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.b_tt:0 "You advise the noblemen against dueling."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.c:0 "Perhaps she'd be more interested in me..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0001.c_tt:0 "You invite the paramour back to your bedchamber."

 agot_filler_dorne.0002.t:0 "A Child Born of Passion"
 agot_filler_dorne.0002.desc:0 "The paramour that was hotly contested by those two nobles earlier this year has sent me something to remember her by... #bold a bastard son#!. The boy arrived in the early hours of the morning, the mother nowhere to be seen. But looking at the child, I can undoubtedly feel he is mine."
 agot_filler_dorne.0002.a:0 "Oh... to live and love, I suppose."

 agot_filler_dorne.0003.desc:0 "As I'm shopping in a bazaar, I come upon a new merchant I have not seen here before. He is a Sandy Dornishman, and his common tongue is thick with a Red Mountains drawl. He spots me and waves me over.\n\nI quickly see he is another food merchant, but his wares are... peculiar. He is selling cooked scorpions. He has baskets and baskets of the creatures and is roasting them on a fire next to his stand. He even has some spices ready to use.\n\nHe offers me a small specimen to sample."
 agot_filler_dorne.0003.a:0 "It tastes... like... chicken?"
 agot_filler_dorne.0003.b:0 "How kind, but I'm not trying that."
 agot_filler_dorne.0003.b_tt:0 "The merchant is displeased at your reluctance."

 agot_filler_dorne.0004.desc:0 "The sun is bearing down upon all of Dorne with a terrible fervor. The maesters call it a heatwave, but it is how I imagine the Seven Hells feel. Hot. Dry. Arid.\n\nAs the heat continues to punish Dorne, many smallfolk are scrambling for water. The communal water wells are having trouble supplying so many thirsty people at once, and now the smallfolk of my demesne are asking me for water from my own private water wells..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0004.a:0 "Double the guards around my water wells."
 agot_filler_dorne.0004.b:0 "Offer them aid, but don't be wasteful."
 agot_filler_dorne.0004.c:0 "Heatwaves and drought are not new to Dorne. They get nothing of mine."

 agot_filler_dorne.0005.desc:0 "I reach into the bowl and pluck out a juicy and plump blood orange. A native fruit of Dorne, one of the many perks of ruling in Dorne is the cheap access to such a delicious and quenching fruit.\n\nI peel the orange, tossing the skin into the bowl, and I sink my teeth into the fruit. The juices flow all down my chin and dribble into my lap, but the taste, oh, the taste! It's so... quenchy."
 agot_filler_dorne.0005.a:0 "Ahhh, so delicious."

 agot_filler_dorne.0006.desc:0 "A new horse breeder has been producing exceptionally superior Dornish Sand Steeds recently. Unlike other breeders, this man's stock is notably faster, more durable, and more beautiful than other breeders' horses. While the Dornish Sand Steed is already superior to the other horses of Westeros, this man's stock seems to be a new generation of powerful horses.\n\nAnd to make matters more interesting, it seems the man does not know the value of his horses... he is selling the steeds at a meager cost!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0006.a:0 "Buy the man's entire stock."
 agot_filler_dorne.0006.b:0 "Strike a business deal and reap the economic benefits."
 agot_filler_dorne.0006.c:0 "Seize the horses and arrest the man for undercutting prices."

 agot_filler_dorne.0007.desc:0 "It behoves a Dornish [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord] to have spice cabinets always stocked with the richest and hottest spices available. If our food is not spiced, then we are no more than savages.\n\nAnd so it seems I am the savage today... a meek servant tells me that my spice cabinets are #italic completely empty#!. Oh... the horror.\n\nHow will my reputation recover from this?"
 agot_filler_dorne.0007.a:0 "Now my food will be as bland as a Reachman's..."

 agot_filler_dorne.0010.a:0 "Damnation! Proceed with the repairs."
 agot_filler_dorne.0010.b:0 "Spare no expense with the repairs."

 agot_filler_dorne.0011.desc:0 "A traveling Dornish musician performing for my court has played a tune so hauntingly beautiful that I cannot forget it.\n\nDressed in his samite robes and his linen headscarf, the musician played his oud as if he and the instrument were two long and storied lovers. The way he plucked the instrument's strings was simply blissful... I'm sure this man will be playing for the Seven one day."

 agot_filler_dorne.0012.desc:0 "I overheard some of my courtiers discussing how a mother from a remote desert village had her babe stolen in the night. My courtiers seem to think that the desert-dwelling scavengers known as sand dogs scurried into the village and stole the babe for a midnight snack.\n\nWhile sand dogs are vicious desert scavengers, I'm not sure they'd steal a babe from its home in the dead of the night. Then again, a small and fleshy babe is an easy target..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0012.a:0 "Glad I'm safe in my castle at night..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0012.b:0 "Bah! That's just a trader's tall tale."

A whole barrel wasted! All because this servant tried to carry it by himself.\n\nHe looks up and sees me standing in the doorway, his face suddenly alight with not only dismay but fear as well. The other servants have gone quiet in my presence as well - they are waiting to see how I will react."
 agot_filler_dorne.0013.a:0 "Damnation! Clean it up, #S now!#!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0013.b:0 "You'll be disciplined for this."

 agot_filler_dorne.0014.desc:0 "#S CRASH#! The inn door bangs open, and I see several Reachman knights strut into the hall. They jeer and jape as they pass several men sitting down, loudly whispering something about 'smelling Dornish'. I grip my tankard tightly as they approach the innkeep; I cringe as one of them spits in his face and snatches the flagon of wine from his hands. The men erupt into laughter as another knight grabs a whole roast chicken from the serving wench, grabbing her and holding her tightly. The innkeep shouts at them, but a quick blow to the face silences him.\n\nAs he rubs his face, his eyes meet mine... He knows I am a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], I've eaten here before, after all... The look on his face is a plea for help..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0014.a:0 "Hey, you ugly Reachman, over here!"

Argh!\n\nI reach into my sack to draw my veil out, but I notice it's nowhere to be found! It seems in my haste to leave, I forgot to pack it..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0015.a:0 "This is going to be a long trip..."

It seems every minor grievance between the two groups of worshippers is being blown out of proportion, with each group looking for the most minor issue to escalate into violence.\n\nThe village leaders are asking me to issue a ruling, hoping the villagers would respect a lord's command..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0016.a:0 "You will coexist or you will not exist at #italic all#!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0016.b:0 "Local politics don't interest me..."

 agot_filler_dorne.0020.desc:0 "A bazaar has recently opened up in [agot_filler_dorne_0020_baazar_location.GetName]. Several foreign and Westerosi merchants have likewise set up shop, displaying a dazzling array of goods and services.\n\nWhile walking through the bazaar, one merchant catches my eye: he is a tall man with a plain face and a strange outfit. Behind him are two burly guards, each brandishing an arakh.\n\nThe man is selling hand-crafted jewelry. As I step closer, a young man roughly bumps into me, #N causing me to knock over — and break — the vendor's entire collection!#! The merchant howls with rage, and suddenly the guards seize me before I can even get up... The merchant demands immediate restitution, #italic or else!#!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.a:0 "O-okay, here, take this gold, please!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.a_tt:0 "You offer the merchant a fair sum of gold for your freedom."
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.b:0 "Get off of me! It was an accident!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.b_tt:0 "You try to convince the merchant it was an accident."
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.c:0 "Where are my guards? Help, someone help!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.c_tt:0 "You panic and call for help."
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.d:0 "I'll fight you!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0020.d_tt:0 "You begin a fight."

 agot_filler_dorne.0021.t:0 "The Bazaar: Offer of Gold"
 agot_filler_dorne.0021.desc:0 "The merchant's guards tighten their grip as I whimper out my offer. The merchant dramatically ponders this - he rubs his chin, paces around the wrecked stall, and even asks one of the guards for their opinion.\n\nFinally, the merchant looks at me and simply says, "I need #bold more than that#!. My wares are worth far more!" Outraged, I begin to respond, but a #bold hand strikes#! me across the face! The merchant tells me he doesn't want to hear my objections. Only how much restitution he will get. He leans in and tells me that his guards hit far harder than he does..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0021.a:0 "Fine! You can have more gold!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0021.a_tt:0 "You offer to pay the merchant a #bold large#! sum of gold."

 agot_filler_dorne.0022.t:0 "The Bazaar: Bribe Paid"
 agot_filler_dorne.0022.desc:0 "The merchant smirks as you promise him an exorbitant amount of gold. As I hand him the gold, he signals for the guards to leave me. As they walk away, I can see the man that bumped into me, starting this whole mess, join them and laugh!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0022.a:0 "Damnation!"

 agot_filler_dorne.0023.t:0 "The Bazaar: No way!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0023.desc:0 "When I tell the merchant that I refuse to pay more, his face grows hot with rage. He motions for the guards to drag me into a dark alleyway.\n\nThey pin me against a wall and start to attack me. Each blow causes me to see stars and my vision to blacken. As one blow connects with my jaw, I feel a tooth fly out. Blood trickles from my face in a number of spots. A sudden darkness seems to set in..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0023.a:0 "Ouch..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0023.a_tt:0 "You are brutally beaten and robbed."

 agot_filler_dorne.0024.t:0 "The Bazaar: A Trade"
 agot_filler_dorne.0024.desc:0 ""Lands of my own," the merchant repeats, a grin spreading across his face, "Yes, yes that'll do. That'll do. You'll sign papers making me the ruler of these lands, so no funny business!"\n\nThe merchant motions for the guards to ease their grip on me while he writes something on a parchment. After some time, he produces an official-looking document that says I'll grant him titles and lands... How does he know how to write so well?"
 agot_filler_dorne.0024.a:0 "My spare lands for my life, deal..."

 agot_filler_dorne.0025.t:0 "The Bazaar: Negotiation"
 agot_filler_dorne.0025.desc:0 ""Get off of me, get off of me!" I shout, "it was an accident, I swear! We can talk about this — we can negotiate!" The merchant hears my plea and smiles. He looks at me and says, "You're right; it was an accident. But you caused the accident. So let's #italic negotiate#! a repayment price...""
 agot_filler_dorne.0025.a:0 "Right... let's talk."
 agot_filler_dorne.0025.a.success:0 "You haggle down a repayment price."

 agot_filler_dorne.0026.t:0 "The Bazaar: Help!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0026.desc:0 "As the guards tighten their grip on me, I look around wildly. I shout as loud as I can for my guards, for anyone, to help me.\n\nSuddenly, the merchant yelps, and a patrolman passing by spots us. He runs over, causing the two guards to flee immediately. The merchant tries to run, but he trips on the wreckage of his wares!\n\nI thank the patrolman, who tells me that the merchant is a known scammer who has been extorting people across Dorne!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0026.a:0 "Thank goodness you heard me."

 agot_filler_dorne.0027.t:0 "The Bazaar: Help!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0027.desc:0 "As the guards tighten their grip on me, I look around wildly. I shout as loud as I can for my guards, for anyone, to help me. Unfortunately, it quickly becomes apparent that no one is coming to my aid...\n\nThe merchant says that I'm too much of a risk and jerks his head towards a dark alley... I shout for desperate help as I'm dragged off into the alleyway and beaten mercilessly!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0027.a:0 "Ouch..."

 agot_filler_dorne.0028.t:0 "The Bazaar: FIGHT!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0028.desc:0 "As the merchant is rambling on in front of me, I realize that these guards probably aren't expecting someone trained in combat to fall for their scam...\n\nWith a quick movement, I strike the guards with a headbutt, temporarily disorienting them and duck out from their grip. I pull out a dagger and dodge the blows from one of the guards. As I roll past him, I stab him in his unprotected stomach. I grab his arakh and point it at the other guard, who flees immediately.\n\nI step towards the frozen merchant and point the two blades at him, daring him to attack me..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0028.a:0 "The merchant draws his own dagger. He wants to #bold FIGHT!#!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0028.a.success:0 "#P I slay my enemy.#!"

 agot_filler_dorne.0035.desc:0 "While traveling along the Greenblood, I've come across a man and his son fishing from the shore. The man is tall, black-haired, and almost regal. His son is but a boy, but he favors his father heavily. After talking to the man, he tells me he is a fisher by trade but cannot resist fishing for leisure. How quaint.\n\nBefore I depart, the man offers to take me fishing onboard his pole boat... he says it is an opportunity that will change my perception of fishing."
 agot_filler_dorne.0035.a:0 "That sounds like fun."
 agot_filler_dorne.0035.a_tt:0 "You will board the boat."

 agot_filler_dorne.0036.desc:0 "The fisher helps me onboard, and we set sail down the river. He hands me a spare rod and shows me how to cast it into the water. I sit down on a bucket as my line sinks under the water... eagerly waiting..."

 agot_filler_dorne.0037.desc:0 "I feel the fish swallow the hook and yank as hard as I can. I begin reeling and reeling and reeling... and next thing I know, at the end of my rod is an enormous whiskerfish. It takes both the guide and my combined strength to haul it over the ledge of the boat. My guide clasps me on the back and proclaims a job well done!"
 agot_filler_dorne.0037.a:0 "That was thrilling!"

 agot_filler_dorne.0038.t:0 "Fishing on the Greenblood"

I reel in as hard as I can, inching closer to the shore...\n\nAt last, at the end of my rod, is a less-than-modest fish. The fisherman calls it a white perch. The fish is tiny, so we throw it back into the water. I watch as it swims away..."
 agot_filler_dorne.0040.a:0 "At least I caught something!"

 agot_filler_dorne.0041.t:0 "Fishing on the Greenblood Shoreline"
 agot_filler_dorne.0041.desc:0 "I sit with my line in the water for what seems like hours. I reel it in, add new bait, and cast it out, but still... nothing bites. After some time, I decide it is time to leave. I have work to get back to..."
