 agot_filler_btw.100.desc:0 "A few weeks ago, a hunter who lives near my hall came to me and told me that some new, unwanted neighbors had made themselves at home on my land. They're a small clan, no more than a dozen or so—primarily children or spearwives.\n\nWhile they're no real nuisance to me, many of my men complain that they're overhunting, and the elk have begun to move away from our woods. The loudest among them have told me I ought to do something about an enemy clan muscling in on my land."
 agot_filler_btw.100.a:0 "I'll send my warriors to scare them off."
 agot_filler_btw.100.a.tt:0 "They'll be clever enough not to come back."

 agot_filler_btw.200.desc:0 "While out on the hunt today, [marshal.GetTitledFirstName] and I stumbled upon a direwolf lying bloodied in the snow. The beast's jaw had been broken, its stomach cut, and its body littered with wounds. Yet the direwolf clung doggedly to life.\n\nSeeing this powerful beast in such a sorry state would fill any man's heart with fear. What sort of monster could have done such a thing?"
 agot_filler_btw.200.a:0 "Such a sight is a bad omen! We must let none venture from their homes at night."
 agot_filler_btw.200.a.tt:0 "You put the beast out of its misery and continue on your way."
 agot_filler_btw.200.b:0 "No matter; the poor beast needs to be nursed back to health."
 agot_filler_btw.200.b.tt:0 "You and your party carry the direwolf back to your hall."
 agot_filler_btw.200.c:0 "Let nature take its course."

 agot_filler_btw.201.t:0 "A Wounded Direwolf: Recovery"
 agot_filler_btw.201.desc:0 "Since my men and I brought it home, the direwolf's health has markedly improved. We set its jaw straight and tended to its wounds — and though at first it would neither eat nor drink, it began to accept my table scraps after a day.\n\nThe beast seems to have grown attached to me as I've cared for it, and though it is now back in fighting condition, it seems to wish to stay by my side."
 agot_filler_btw.201.a:0 "He will make for a fearsome companion."
 agot_filler_btw.201.a.tt:0 "And he will surely make hunting all the easier!"

 agot_filler_btw.400.desc:0 "On a lengthy hunting expedition, my party and I have meandered all the way to the tip of Storrold's Point and come across that most accursed of places beyond the Wall: #bold Hardhome#!. Though wilderness has, indeed, overtaken the charred remnants of the settlement, the frigid weather has done its best to preserve the remains of the settlement.\n\nThough others in my party are reticent to journey down the cliffs to explore the ruins of the once lively settlement, I dismiss their concerns and journey down to see what remains... But as I wander through the frozen waste, it appears to me, as bright as morning snow — a vision, however brief, of the horrors that happened that night, centuries ago!\n\nA mother runs from the doorway of her house, her body engulfed in flame as she holds her babe in her arms; the poor little one, burnt to a crisp. The fire swells all around, and it glows so hot that one might think they stood within the depths of the sun itself. The screams are deafened only by the chorus of people coughing the smoke from their lungs.\n\nAnd then it was over."
 agot_filler_btw.400.a:0 "I return to my party, shaken to my very core."
 agot_filler_btw.400.a.tt:0 "Do not forget. This visitation is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose..."

 agot_filler_btw.500.desc:0 "A morning like this is any free folk's dream — crisp mountain air with a frosty bite that tastes of freedom.\n\nI'm enjoying my solitude when a robed man approaches, ecstatic to see me. How long he must have wandered this wilderness alone!\n\nHe introduces himself as [maester.GetTitledFirstName], a #italic maester#! of the #italic Citadel#! who has traveled far north to learn about our people. He boldly asks for a seat at my table to discuss his mission in more detail."
 agot_filler_btw.500.a:0 "Invite him in."
 agot_filler_btw.500.a.tt:0 "He has wandered this far; I ought to at least hear him out."

 agot_filler_btw.501.desc:0 "I invite [maester.GetTitledFirstName] into my service to break bread with members of my clan. He may be from south of the Wall, but his knowledge of the far north is impressive. He regales me with facts about the Frostfangs and the Frozen Shore, of the Antler River and the Shivering Sea. Even my men are awed.\n\nAs supper comes to an end, I see the maester's face turn serious. "I've traveled many days and months, my friend, but my purpose requires much more time," he says with a pained grin, crow's feet gathering at the corners of his eyes. "If you would have me, I'd be honored to stay as a guest in your hall, documenting the life of your 'free folk' for the histories.""
 agot_filler_btw.501.a:0 "For whose histories, eh?"
 agot_filler_btw.501.a.tt:0 "You deny his request and send him on his way, never to return again."
 agot_filler_btw.501.b:0 "I will allow it."
 agot_filler_btw.501.b.tt:0 "Surely this maester may have knowledge to share with my people while he learns of our customs."

 agot_filler_btw.502.desc:0 "At long last, [maester.GetTitledFirstName] has completed his writings, recording every story from my people and surveying the lands for the various trees and flowers. We spent many a trek wandering the mountains, searching for coldsnaps and frostfires, ironwoods and soldier pines.\n\nNow that he prepares to depart, I find myself at a loss for words."
 agot_filler_btw.502.a:0 "We share an ancient handshake of my people as a heartfelt goodbye."
 agot_filler_btw.502.a.tt:0 "My people have learned much from this learned man. With his wisdom, we may better ward off sickness in the days to come."

 agot_filler_btw.600.desc:0 "Extremely few envy living in such a frosted land, but fewer still know the beauty of the ice on those rare days when the weather allows it.\n\nToday is such a day.\n\nThere is a frozen lake near the capital that I might visit, and I can see in the distance that it looks astounding."
