 agot_filler_braavos.0002.desc: "A raucous crowd draws my attention to a small stage where a flamboyant troupe performs a biting satire. The actors, clad in outlandish costumes, mock a well-known noble with exaggerated flourishes and sharp-tongued humor.\n\nLaughter ripples through the audience, but not all share in the amusement — some exchange uneasy glances, wary of who might be watching.

There, beneath the lantern-lit arches, a gathered crowd watches in silent awe as two bravos glide across the surface of the water, their blades flickering like silver in the dusk. This is water dancing — Braavosi swordplay at its most fluid and precise.\n\nNoticing my interest, a seasoned instructor, [meeting_warrior.GetFirstName], turns to me with a knowing smile. "Curious?" [meeting_warrior.GetSheHe] asks, gesturing toward the open space. "Come. Let us see if your feet are as quick as your eyes.""

"Ever raced to unseal the sea's little coffers?" [meeting_peasantmale.GetSheHe|U] asks. Apparently, the contest is simple: Pry open as many oysters as possible before time runs out. The prize?
