 agot_travel_events.0001.a:0 "A fine place to rest tonight."
 agot_travel_events.0001.a.tt:0 "You make a stop at the inn."

 agot_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "We arrive at a most opportune time, the inn is full of life and roars with laughter.\n\nAt the back, I spot a group of knights drinking, and by the look of their faces, they must have arrived long before us... Perhaps I could join them? \n\nTo my side, [fellow_traveler.GetName] invites me to share mead, mayhaps I could take the opportunity to spend more time with [fellow_traveler.GetHerHim] outdoors instead?"

Most of my men are either dead or have deserted. If I don't find a contract to occupy the rest soon, I fear they will all leave... or worse."\n\nAfter guzzling another round, [sellsword.GetSheHe] adds: "Perhaps this life is not right for me and it would be for the better, at least I'd have a chance to return home." Yet, despite his bitterness I can see a glimpse of determination in his eyes..."

Look who it is! [ROOT.Char.GetName] [ROOT.Char.GetHerselfHimself]!"\n\nThough [drunk_knight.GetSheHe] seems to know me, I cannot recognize [drunk_knight.GetHerHim]. Before I can even hope to respond, the knight draws his sword and challenges me: "I wonder, is it true you're as good as they say? Or perhaps you're just a coward in a fancy armor?"\n\nThe inn slowly goes silent and I can feel everybody's gaze upon me."
 agot_travel_events.0004.a:0 "If you're looking for a fight, you'll get one!"

"All you have to do, is catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step."\n\n"Oh, I bet a fine warrior like yourself can do it, no problem!" [drunk_ironborn.GetSheHe|l] adds laughingly."

 agot_travel_events.0006.desc:0 "Once we get closer, the atmosphere grows uneasy. As I push the door, we are greeted by the sight of overturned tables and shattered glass. \n\nThe innkeeper welcomes us with a worried look on [innkeeper.GetHerHis] face: "Apologies travelers, I'm afraid you won't find the warm welcome you were looking for here. A group of bandits attacked the inn recently, we managed to fend them off, but I worry they will return soon with revenge."\n\n"We could use some capable hands, though.""

The two combatants take their stances, the air turning thin with tension. The blades jolt out, and the dance begins. After a moment that feels like an eternity, [tryouts_winner.GetName] leaves [tryouts_winner.GetHerHis] opponent alone in the dirt."

Before I can begin though, [3000_county_liege.GetName] holds up a hand, announcing that due to my station, I will head straight to the single combat stage of the contest, facing one of the best warriors of the would-be raiders.

Back and forth we go, swords dancing between us in a blur, in a moment of complete clarity I see an opening. My weapon finds its way home, and the duel is over. As I stand victorious I glance around, and from [3000_county_liege.GetNamePossessive] face I can tell that this isn't the outcome [3000_county_liege.GetSheHe] was hoping for. Still, it would be a waste not to use this victory to my advantage."

 # Laughter in the Trees
 agot_travel_events.4000.t:0 "Laughter in the Trees"
 agot_travel_events.4000.desc:0 "As we make our way through the thick forest, I am overcome by the feeling of being watched. With every passing moment, the rustling of the trees sounds more and more like whispers — and the anxious expressions on the faces of my companions indicate that they too share my perception. Just then, an unmistakable sound of laughter, high-pitched as if belonging to a child, reaches us from deeper within the forest. Soon other, similarly childish voices join the chorus of seemingly amused snickering that echoes, disturbingly, all around us."
 agot_travel_events.4000.unknownchildren.desc:0 "I try to make out any silhouettes among the trees, but the forest is too thick. The source of the laughter remains as mysterious as it is unsettling."
 agot_travel_events.4000.knownchildren.desc:0 "Given where we are, there can only be one conclusion: We are being watched by our elusive neighbors, the Children of the Forest."

 agot_travel_events.4001.desc:0 "Overcome with anger, I dive among the trees with vindictive intent. The snickering doesn't stop, and no matter how fast I run, it remains too distant to get a line of sight on the offenders. The frustration fuels my anger, but eventually the need to catch breath takes priority over the chase and I realize that I left my party far behind. I am alone, surrounded by noticeably less amused and more contemptuous laughter."
 agot_travel_events.4001.a:0 "Show yourselves or I'll have this whole forest burnt down!"
 agot_travel_events.4001.a.tt:0 "You attempt to taunt the voices out of hiding"
 agot_travel_events.4001.b:0 "I... I shouldn't have gotten myself into this spot."

 agot_travel_events.4002.a.tt:0 "As the forest around you fades to black, you hear a salvo of laughter erupting one final time"

 agot_travel_events.4003.desc:0 "The whispers and giggles follow us as we make our way to the first clearing suitable for a campsite. Our effort to prepare for nightfall is audibly no small source of amusement for the Children, as the laughter picks up every time we start a new task, but by the time we settle in it dies down and gives way to a somewhat more distant sound of singing. Getting their fill of novelty, the Children of the Forest decided to spend their evening sharing a song, the same way we often do. But we dare not compete, as their singing is more beautiful than anything any of us have ever heard. As we sit around the fire, I hear dewy-eyed [other_traveller.GetName] whisper, "I would give anything to keep listening to that.""
 agot_travel_events.4003.a:0 "On that note, we should leave a gift."

As I survey the campsite, I find my entourage in an apparently similar mood. The Children of the Forest are nowhere to be heard, but the memory of yesterday evening lingers on."
