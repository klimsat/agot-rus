 agot_silly_mode.0002.desc:0 ""Mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], Aegon has been secured in one of the deepest cells of the Dragonpit," the Dragonkeeper announces, bowing slightly. "I'm unsure why you requested him to be imprisoned there, rather than in the Black Cells, but if a place is fit to contain a dragon, it should surely hold a man."\n\nI stare at him, bewildered. Some might call Aegon “Egg,” but how could my order to have all the unsecured dragon eggs moved to the pits for hatching have been so terribly misinterpreted?"

 agot_silly_mode.0100.desc:0 "Another day, another menial task. Ruling can be so terribly banal sometimes, the only surprise being the occasional competence of those around me.\n\nToday is different, to my chagrin, when in bursts a scaly fellow — a being both fell, and low — with a #italic strange gift!#! "Fresh #bold pie#!, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]," the shadowy figure states in chipper tone. "Straight from the kitchen. A strange girl supplied us the most delicate of meats for its filling."\n\nI'm not in the habit of trusting strange victuals from strangers, yet the aroma is so delightful..."
 agot_silly_mode.0100.a:0 "Just a bite..."
 agot_silly_mode.0100.b:0 "Best not."

 agot_silly_mode.0200.desc:0 "The cook enters, his footsteps hesitant, eyes wide with apprehension. "You sent for me, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]?"\n\n"Yes, I would like an omelette. A very special one," I reply, twisting to the side to pick up my chosen victim.\n\nHis brows furrow in confusion, but that quickly shifts to utter shock as I place the dragon egg in his trembling hands. "I... I'm not sure I... If it is what you wish," he stammers, looking at the egg as though it might explode at any moment.\n\nI offer him a nod, my grin widening. "I'm feeling rather peckish. Don't take too long.""
 agot_silly_mode.0200.a:0 "I can't wait!"

 agot_silly_mode.0201.t:0 "An Egg-cellent Idea"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.desc:0 "The cook returns, looking worn and slightly disheveled. He places the plate before me with a nervous gesture, the omelette appearing perfectly ordinary. Nothing about it suggests the legendary dragon egg it was made from. It's golden-brown, slightly fluffy, and smells faintly of herbs.\n\n"I... I hope it is to your liking, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]," he says, his voice shaky.\n\nI peer down at the dish, disappointed. No glowing, no magical aura, just a well-made breakfast. I take a bite."
 agot_silly_mode.0201.a:0 "It's... wonderful!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.b:0 "Egg-ceptional!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.c:0 "Egg-straordinary!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.d:0 "Egg-semplary work, chef!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.e:0 "Egg-sactly what I hoped and dreamed!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.f:0 "I can't egg-nore the fine taste!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.g:0 "This... this is egg-stasy!"

 agot_silly_mode.0302.t:0 "Tentacular Teardown"
 agot_silly_mode.0302.desc:0 "The raiders surge through Oldtown in a tide of tide of salt and steel. As they reach the shadow of the Hightower, the sea roars in defiance — or welcome. A colossal surge erupts from the harbor, drowning dozens as a monstrous kraken rises from the depths. Its titanic tentacles, thick as castle walls, coil around the ancient tower. With a groan of rending stone, the Hightower wrenches free from its foundations and vanishes beneath the waves, lost to the deep."
 agot_silly_mode.0302.a:0 "The sea remembers."
 agot_silly_mode.0302.b:0 "Wha-what?"
