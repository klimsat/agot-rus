 agot_silly_mode.0002.desc:0 ""Mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], Aegon has been secured in one of the deepest cells of the Dragonpit," the Dragonkeeper announces, bowing slightly. "I'm unsure why you requested him to be imprisoned there, rather than in the Black Cells, but if a place is fit to contain a dragon, it should surely hold a man."\n\nI stare at him, bewildered. Some might call Aegon “Egg,” but how could my order to have all the unsecured dragon eggs moved to the pits for hatching have been so terribly misinterpreted?"

 agot_silly_mode.0100.desc:0 "Another day, another menial task. Ruling can be so terribly banal sometimes, the only surprise being the occasional competence of those around me.\n\nToday is different, to my chagrin, when in bursts a scaly fellow — a being both fell, and low — with a #italic strange gift!#! "Fresh #bold pie#!, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]," the shadowy figure states in chipper tone. "Straight from the kitchen. A strange girl supplied us the most delicate of meats for its filling."\n\nI'm not in the habit of trusting strange victuals from strangers, yet the aroma is so delightful..."
 agot_silly_mode.0100.a:0 "Just a bite..."
 agot_silly_mode.0100.b:0 "Best not."

 agot_silly_mode.0200.desc:0 "The cook enters, his footsteps hesitant, eyes wide with apprehension. "You sent for me, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]?"\n\n"Yes, I would like an omelette. A very special one," I reply, twisting to the side to pick up my chosen victim.\n\nHis brows furrow in confusion, but that quickly shifts to utter shock as I place the dragon egg in his trembling hands. "I... I'm not sure I... If it is what you wish," he stammers, looking at the egg as though it might explode at any moment.\n\nI offer him a nod, my grin widening. "I'm feeling rather peckish. Don't take too long.""

 agot_silly_mode.0201.t:0 "An Egg-cellent Idea"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.desc:0 "The cook returns, looking worn and slightly disheveled. He places the plate before me with a nervous gesture, the omelette appearing perfectly ordinary. Nothing about it suggests the legendary dragon egg it was made from. It's golden-brown, slightly fluffy, and smells faintly of herbs.\n\n"I... I hope it is to your liking, mi[ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l]," he says, his voice shaky.\n\nI peer down at the dish, disappointed. No glowing, no magical aura, just a well-made breakfast. I take a bite."
 agot_silly_mode.0201.a:0 "It's... wonderful!"
 agot_silly_mode.0201.b:0 "Egg-ceptional!"

 agot_silly_mode.0302.t:0 "Tentacular Teardown"
 agot_silly_mode.0302.desc:0 "The raiders surge through Oldtown in a tide of tide of salt and steel. As they reach the shadow of the Hightower, the sea roars in defiance — or welcome. A colossal surge erupts from the harbor, drowning dozens as a monstrous kraken rises from the depths. Its titanic tentacles, thick as castle walls, coil around the ancient tower. With a groan of rending stone, the Hightower wrenches free from its foundations and vanishes beneath the waves, lost to the deep."
 agot_silly_mode.0302.a:0 "The sea remembers."

 agot_silly_mode.0501.t:0 "They Worship... a Giant Candle...?"
 agot_silly_mode.0501.westeros_desc:0 "Walking through the drafty corridors of the castle, I am approached by a courtier carrying a sealed raven's scroll. Taking the scroll, I see the wax seal of the Citadel... A sense of urgency falls upon me as I hastily break the seal to open the correspondence, expecting the worst.\n\nOnce open, I begin to read, only to realize that it is merely a message being forwarded from [messenger.GetName] of [GetTitleByKey('k_the_wall').GetName]. It is a report of odd behavior from a group of wildlings far to the north, who are now worshipping what they call the Great Candle — a rumored giant candle that had been hanging in the skies above their lands for generations, and has now mysteriously vanished. I re-read the letter several times before tossing it aside. I stand dumbfounded at what I have just read..."
 agot_silly_mode.0501.not_westeros_desc:0 "Sifting through my unread correspondence, a letter bearing the wax seal of the Citadel in Westeros catches my eye. My curiosity at such a communication gets the better of me; I decide to give it my attention first.\n\nOpening the letter, I begin to read and realize that it is a message being forwarded from [messenger.GetName] of [GetTitleByKey('k_the_wall').GetName]. It is a report of strange behavior from a group of wildlings far to the north, who are now worshipping what they call the Great Candle — a rumored giant candle that had been hanging in the skies above their lands for generations, and has now mysteriously vanished. I re-read the letter several times before cradling my head in my hands... What did I just read?"
 agot_silly_mode.0501.nw_westeros_desc:0 "It's always so damn cold at [GetTitleByKey('k_the_wall').GetName]... It is said by some that you get used to it, but that is clearly a fable people tell themselves in an attempt to make it true. Trying to distract myself, I think back to the interrogation that occurred earlier in the day with a wildling captured by a ranging party. The madman had been spouting all manner of nonsensical ravings about a different wildling tribe far to the north who had taken to worshipping a Great Candle in the sky. The claim was insane, even by the wildlings' savage standards... It makes one wonder what kind of world lies so far north that it could drive people to such madness."
 agot_silly_mode.0501.btw_westeros_desc:0 "The Lakeman tribes have always been strange... Rumors about them among the other Free Folk spoke of perplexing practices of worship involving a giant candle in the sky. Recently, whispers of these practices have become louder and more frequent, saying that the Great Candle, as it was called, had moved from its position in their skies. They declared this a bad omen and have become even more zealous as a result... Rumors claim they are sacrificing other tribes to bring their candle back to the sky once again. It is sheer madness — almost terrifying to dwell upon for too long."
 agot_silly_mode.0501.a:0 "What is going on up there?"

 agot_silly_mode.0502.t:0 "CAN-DLE, CAN-DLE, CAN-DLE..."
 agot_silly_mode.0502.desc:0 "It has been some time since the Great Candle moved from its place above our lands of the Ice Lakes. I do not believe there was ever a time the Great Candle was not above us, blocking the light of the sun from reaching us... watching over our people... Since that fateful day when the Great Candle shifted itself, we have no longer been under its divine shadow. My people are lost without the Great Candle to guide us. We are aimlessly stumbling through this newfound, blaring light.\n\nI know what I must do... I must unite my people under a glorious new path toward enlightenment, with the Great Candle as our guide! Perhaps if we dedicate our lives to living in the name of the Great Candle, we can guide it back above our lands and restore us to our former glory.\n\nI must travel and make known this new way of life — to pass on the wisdom and guidance of the Great Candle..." #CANDLE!!!!!
