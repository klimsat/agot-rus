With a turn of my heels, I direct [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to hover above the courtyard, and rain dragonflame down on the helpless sods below.\n\nBut as we burn men beneath our mighty presence, I feel a sudden heat in my side, and I shout as it radiates into pain.

Such bravery, or foolishness, I cannot tell, but as I direct [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] to turn and face him, I am surprised to see the man's spear fly from his hands, and strike me square in the chest! The air is driven from my lungs, and I cannot even howl with [sieging_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip].\n\nI am dimly aware of the lurch as [sieging_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] rises into the sky, my limp form strapped down, head lolling back to stare at the sky.
