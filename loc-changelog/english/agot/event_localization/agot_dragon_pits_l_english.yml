 agot_dragon_pits.0001.desc:0 "The Dragonpit of King's Landing has been restored to its former glory!\n\nSince the Dance of the Dragons and the storming by the smallfolk, the great pit had been a shadow of its former self; a ruin not fit for purpose.\n\nBut the rubble of that night has now been swept away. And even though the glory of the structure has been restored, the pit itself is still without purpose. Perhaps doomed only to serve as the grandest display hall for what few eggs remain to the throne.\n\nHowever, lords and ladies across Westeros have begun to wonder whether the restoration was motivated by desire to honor the past or a twisted ambition for the future..."

The return of dragons has heralded a renewed need for the pit to once again serve as the home to the beasts, far away from the peasantry of the city.\n\nAs apprehensive as lords and smallfolk alike are to the return of dragons, few are opposed to the restoration of the Dragonpit, which now stands as a glorious monument to the renewed power of the throne."

 agot_dragon_pits.0005.elsewhere:0 "Highborn and commoner alike stand in awe at the mighty structure that may soon house dragons beneath its domed roof.
