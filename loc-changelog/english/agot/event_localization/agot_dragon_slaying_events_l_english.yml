 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.t:0 "The Dragon's Den"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.neck:0 "The usual smell of the marshes has been harassing my nose for days, so much so that I have finally gotten used to it, which is why a new scent — unfamiliar to me, yet somehow reminiscent of rotten eggs — catches me off guard, yet I know that I am on the right track. The maze of mire, peat, and mud is finally marked with mutilated carcasses and charred bones... I just have to follow the trail.\n\nIt takes me to a rocky mound, covered with vegetation. It is hollow, judging by the entrance which opens directly onto a marshy pond. If [dragon.GetNameNicknamed] lives here, [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] probably has to wade through the water. A curious choice for a lair, but at least the place guarantees [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] a certain tranquility. Caution is required, because facing a dragon is already difficult, but in terrain as treacherous as sticky mud and opaque waters, I cannot be sure of anything."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.north:0 "Snow and grass crunch beneath my feet as I walk in the shadows of a dense cover of green soldier pines. The cave is set into a tall snow-covered mound that seems to be battling its way free from the earth. The treeline abruptly ends; the pines surrounding the mound having been felled or shattered — broken into gnarled pieces of trunk and bark, their needles leaving scattered clumps of green amidst the snow.\n\nA thick cloud of black smoke curls up from the mouth of the cave, reaching toward the cloudy sky before being scattered by the frigid wind. This is certainly the lair of [dragon.GetNameNicknamed]. The charred bones of [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] prey left in a pile just through the cave's entrance. How should I approach this beast? Should I even try?"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.vale:0 "The Mountains of the Moon cast sheer shadows across the landscape as I continue my search for [dragon.GetNameNicknamed]. [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')|U] lair must be hidden among these cliffs, but how am I to find it when I can barely traverse by foot?\n\nFortune favors my boldness this day, as I crest a steep outcrop and spot a sliver-like cavern tucked amid the grey-green face of the mountain. The earth around its entrance is littered with charred carcasses, and my heart jumps at my dawning realization: I've found my prize, but now I must win it..."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.dorne:0 "The sandy dunes have provided little reprieve as I scour the lands for [dragon.GetNameNicknamed]. At times I've felt delirious, lacking sufficient water among the desert sands. Today, before me only a stone's toss away, I see it: a shifting cavern, drifting in and out of visibility as if a mirage.\n\nMy joy quickly sours, like a Dornish red turned to vinegar... This is where I must make my stand against [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip], but my fate could slip through my fingers as swiftly as the sands."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.danwell:0 "I have tracked [dragon.GetNameNicknamed] to [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lair, a warm and damp cave not far from [dragon.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. A foul odor clings to the air, a repelling scent of decay ripe with the smell of seared flesh. Littered on the stones of the cave entrance are the charred remains of humans and animals alike. What horrors lurk beyond the mouth of this foreboding cavern? What challenges await?"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.roselyse:0 "I have tracked [dragon.GetNameNicknamed] to [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lair, a void colored grotto near to [dragon.GetCurrentLocation.GetName], cradled by moss-carpeted stone and glutinous verdure. A thick rolling fog permeates as I silently advance. It is as though I am teetering upon the tongue of a titan, its stagnant breath heavy with the scent of rotting flesh.\n\nThere are hints of  movement from further within... A slow rumbling, like that of a gentle rolling thunder. The scent of smoke assaults me and my breath catches in my throat. Surely this is where I will find what I have been seeking... But will I live to tell the tale if I proceed?"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0001.aemmly:0 "After an already frightful and perilous journey, I have tracked the beast [dragon.GetNameNicknamed] to [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] den, a cave cast in the deepest of shadows, buried in the wild outskirts near [dragon.GetCurrentLocation.GetName]. I take a deep breath and silently advance toward the mouth of the lair, the winds whisper to me warnings as if to declare "#italic turn back!#!" Singed moss and the burnt, devoured carcasses of wildlife litter the floor as I get a better view of the entrance. I cautiously creep forward, unsure if anything is lurking in the nearby darkness. I see #italic shifting#! — but I cannot tell whether it be a bat, bandit, or [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerselfHimself')].\n\nAs I focus I can hear the slow breathing of the dragon within. [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] is here. The only thing left is to press on and notch my mark in the annals of history, but at the last second a thought grips at the back of my mind... can I really do this?"

The shadows of rolling clouds keep me company as I pass.\n\nMy mind is in the clouds when I notice something odd: One of the shadows moving swiftly, and #bold against the wind#!... The realization hits me soon after: Rather than finding [dragon.GetNameNicknamedNoTooltip], [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has found me!\n\nI catch sight of the [dragon.Custom('GetDragonColorFull')] beast diving from the cover of a cloud, with only an instant to decide my next course of action."

 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_burn_risky:0 "\n\nI knew the flames would be hot, but I could not imagine they would be #bold this#! hot.

 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_lunge_cautious:0 "In my caution to avoid [dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] attack, I have given up my defenses. I shuffle to the side, exposing my back, and slowly lumber away from [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]."

 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_tail_climb:0 "My climb is cut short by a sound like whip crack.\n\nThere is no longer pain in my chest or my limbs, there is no feeling at all. The dragon's tail has crushed my spine just below my neck, and I feel myself sloughing off [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] back like a lifeless doll.\n\nUnable to move, I stare into the soul of [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] as [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] prepares to consume me..."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_bite_dive:0 "[dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] watches me closely as I attempt to dive beneath [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. Without missing a beat, [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] jaws close in around me, tossing me into the air.\n\nI land in a crumpled pile, my back to [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_tail_dive:0 "Like a bolt of lightning, [dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] tail cracks through the air, catching me in the spine beneath my neck as I attempt my dive.\n\nThere is no longer pain in my chest or my limbs, there is no feeling at all. I roll uncontrollably on the ground, landing face up. Above me, [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] prepares for a hearty snack."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.confront_bite:0 "[dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] snaps [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] jaws at me, snagging my armor — then tearing at my exposed flesh beneath it. Pain flashes like dragonfire throughout my body."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.confront_tail:0 "[dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] tail whips across my legs, taking them out from under me. I hit the ground with a loud grunt, crumpling to protect my gut. Then [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] tail smashes down onto my head, sending ripples of pain throughout my body."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_crushcrushcrush:0 "My defiant stance turns into my horror as [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] brutally crushes me into the floor...\n\nI hear my bone snapping like fresh-fallen twigs underfoot. My innards pushed upward through my chest and downward out my bottom. The pain is unbearable, yet brief. I am undone."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_crush_move:0 "My attempt at rolling away from the dragon is futile. Unable to get out of the way, I am now pinned to the floor as [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] pushes more and more of [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] weight into me.\n\nI feel my bones splinter and break as I am crushed, a spatchcock of a [ROOT.Char.GetWomanMan]..."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_tail_climb_head:0 "Ack, [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] tail has pinned me between [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] tail and [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] back. I feel the air forced out of my lungs by [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] crushing force.\n\n#italic Breathe, just breathe,#! I tell myself, but the air won't come. I feel dizzy... My dying breath will be a tormented scream."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_tail_climb_roll:0 "I manage to roll off the dragon's back, but the fight is lost. I settle myself into a weak defense, only to be swiped askew by [dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] tail.\n\n"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_shake_climb:0 "I willfully pull myself higher onto [dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] back, but with a ferocious shake [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] tosses me to the ground. I am unable to find any defensive position, this is the end.\n\n"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_shake_roll:0 "I manage to roll off the dragon's back as [dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] shakes violently, but just as quickly [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] is upon me once more.\n\n"
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_fly_hold:0 "We rush upward at a blazing speed, faster by far than any warhorse could carry a man.\n\nI try my hardest to hold on tight, but [dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] does not seem keen to have a passenger. With a brutal shake mid-flight, I find myself airborne. The world below me seems a blur of brown and green, rushing toward me at increasing speed.\n\nI will surely die on impact."
 agot_dragon_slaying_events.0111.desc.death_stop_fly:0 "I should have just let the beast escape. This is clear as [dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] claws scrape across my scalp, and the blood begins to trickle — then #bold pour#! — down my face.\n\nMy sight fades to red as pain rips through my body. [dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] claws are sharp as blades, tearing me apart like a sheep among a pack of wolves. So it ends..."
