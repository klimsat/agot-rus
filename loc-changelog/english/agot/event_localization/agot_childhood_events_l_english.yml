 coin_flip_child_diligent:0 "There are times I wish to curse [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.HighGodName] for my lack of talent, but I know complaining will get me nowhere. Each day is a challenge I intend to conquer; each night, an opportunity to get ahead. I must — nay, #italic will#! — persevere with my own two hands."
 coin_flip_child_learning:0 "If I possess any madness at all, it is that I cannot help but read every book I come across... Wait, has [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetBaseName] madness ever manifested in such a way? I'll have to visit the library and find out if there are any works on the subject!"
 coin_flip_child_martial:0 "Just today, the knights at court gathered to stage a mock siege of the castle. From the castle walls, I watched the ensuing 'battle' unfold and felt as if I were going mad! Every decision made was wrong, and the ideal tactic painfully apparent. #italic Are they fools?#!"
 coin_flip_child_intrigue:0 "Courtiers exchanging subtle glances at court may not realize it, but their not-so-hidden affair is plain as day for anyone to see... or so I thought. But when I mentioned it to another [ROOT.Char.Custom('GirlBoy')|l] at court, [ROOT.Char.GetSheHe] had no idea what I was talking about. I suppose such things come more readily to me."
 coin_flip_child_stewardship:0 "After talking in circles for hours with one of the stewards — whose name I've already forgotten — my head aches, and my mind yearns for sleep. I could die happy if I never had to hear, 'You're quite knowledgeable on matters of coin for your age,' ever again."
 coin_flip_child_diplomacy:0 "Few things have come close to the enjoyment I find in recounting the stories of the Age of Heroes to my utterly captivated audience. The way they hang on my every word, in spite of having heard the tale countless times already... I dare say I have quite a knack for this!"
 coin_flip_child_prowess:0 "My mind drifts once more to swordplay. Strike! Parry! #bold Riposte!#! How often have I watched these same movements when our knights duel? When the chance finally arises for me to duel instead, my reply is simple: Parry! Riposte! #bold Good match!#!"
 coin_flip_child_shrewd:0 "I have argued over and over with my regent that there is something to be said for releasing prisoners as spies instead of executing them. Yet every time, the reply I get is that a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]'s duty is to be just. If only the others saw how justice can be served in more #italic pragmatic#! ways."
 coin_flip_child_genius:0 "Every subject I explore seems to so happily yield its secrets to me. What speech shall I perfect? Stratagem shall I conquer? Plot shall I unfold? Theory shall I unravel? My poor regent is having trouble keeping up! #bold Good.#!"
 coin_flip_child_lunatic_1:0 "The headless king watches from the corner of the room again. I feel his gaze in my wake, his thoughts when I think, his voice as I sleep. Slowly, his stories lull me to rest with tales of my gifted nature, of how similar we are! The more he speaks, the more I understand the truth of his words."
 coin_flip_child_possessed_1:0 "Why do the courtiers watch us as we skip through the halls? Can they feel how special we are? No, no, of course not. But what if they   do know? No one is allowed to know how special we are. They would try to separate us, I can feel it. We will have to plan tonight."
 coin_flip_child_arbitrary:0 "Gifted this, madness that — it's all so dreadfully boring. And childish, too! How would a person even tell? It's not like there's any objective criteria. Why won't the others at court just stop talking about it? I mean, who really cares? I certainly don't, and that is all that matters."
 coin_flip_child_paranoid:0 "I can't sleep. I can't drink or eat. I can't even think. I can feel the way the courtiers watch me — waiting to see if the coin flips heads or tails. They are driving me insane! But... I can't help but wonder too. Am I going mad? Is this the sign? It's all a silly tale, it must be. Meant to keep the other children at court in line. There's no such thing as [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetBaseName] madness... right?"
 coin_flip_child_wrathful:0 "For three weeks, we have been going over the same piece of [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetBaseName] history, and my patience is growing thin with this tutoring. Today I overheard my regent speaking with some courtiers, saying I possess no talents in any particular area. If they do not watch their tongues, I will have to do it for them."
 coin_flip_child_fire_obsessed:0 "I had heard whispers at court of House [GetPlayer.GetHouse.GetBaseName]'s gifted nature, yet I never realized just how visible the gifts would be. Every time I stare into a flickering flame, I see... visions. Glimpses of what I do not know, but the raging fires must be trying to tell me something. Warn me of something? Only in a truly grand pyre will I find the answer."
