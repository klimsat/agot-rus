 agot_hunt_activity.001.t:0 "Stranger on the Road"
 agot_hunt_activity.001.desc:0 "While hunting, I come across a man — a #italic giant#! of a man with wounds down his back. He seems frightened, his gaze darting back and forth as through #italic he himself#! is being hunted.\n\n This stranger seems not to notice me, as I am shrouded by the dense undergrowth. What should I do?"
 agot_hunt_activity.001.a:0 "Reveal myself and try to calm him down."
 agot_hunt_activity.001.b:0 "Stay hidden."
 agot_hunt_activity.001.c:0 "Run away, we are both in danger!"
 agot_hunt_activity.002.t:0 "Staying Hidden"
 agot_hunt_activity.002.desc:0 "As the stranger stops, too tired to run any longer, I can hear him cursing and crying. I swear I make out the phrase "can't go back" muttered over and over.\n\n A few minutes pass as I remain hidden in the darkness of the woods, when suddenly three men appear behind the stranger. They seem to have been looking for him — and not out of kindness. One of the men starts beating him with a slaver's whip!" 
 agot_hunt_activity.002.a:0 "I can do nothing for him now."
 agot_hunt_activity.002.b:0 "I must try to help him!"
 agot_hunt_activity.003.t:0 "A Conversation with the Stranger"
 agot_hunt_activity.003.desc:0 "The stranger introduces himself as a warrior from a noble house across the Narrow Sea. But now, he is merely a slave, after having been captured more than a year ago. He begs me for help — he says he is being chased by his owners!"
 agot_hunt_activity.003.a:0 "I will help him!"
 agot_hunt_activity.003.b:0 "Alas, he must face his destiny."
 agot_hunt_activity.004.t:0 "Leaving the Stranger Behind"
 agot_hunt_activity.004.desc:0 "As I make it further and further away that poor stranger, I hear the frightened screams of young man—and the loud crack of a whip against flesh. The screams become more tortured until, at last, they cease.\n\n I can only imagine the fate that stranger met at the hands of those men he was being hunted by. And I wonder to myself, #italic did I do the right thing?#!"
 agot_hunt_activity.004.a:0 "That's the way it goes..."	
 agot_hunt_activity.004.b:0 "I should have saved him!"	
 agot_hunt_activity.005.t:0 "The Stranger's Keepers"
 agot_hunt_activity.005.desc:0 "Three men approach me. One looks like merchant, in fancy clothes of a foreign fashion, while the other two look like warriors in light leather armor.\n\n The merchant proudly thanks me for capturing his escaped slave, promising that I will be rewarded for my assistance."
 agot_hunt_activity.005.a:0 "Give him back to the men."
 agot_hunt_activity.005.b:0 "With his strength, he must be worth fair coin..."
 agot_hunt_activity.005.c:0 "Perhaps I could use a man of his abilities?"
 agot_hunt_activity.006.t:0 "The Stranger's Keepers"
 agot_hunt_activity.006.desc:0 "I rise from my hiding spot, startling the three men — they thought the punishment was without witness. One of the men, wearing fancy clothes of a foreign fashion, calls to me:\n\n "You ought not be here, friend. Our property here made himself an escape plan, but it didn't work out so well for him," he chirps with an unsettling grin. "Go on and leave us, and there won't be any trouble.""
 agot_hunt_activity.006.a:0 "I don't need to be asked twice!"
 agot_hunt_activity.006.b:0 "Perhaps I could use a man of his abilities?"
 agot_hunt_activity.006.c:0 "Kill them all!"
 agot_hunt_activity.007.t:0 "My New Purchase"
 agot_hunt_activity.007.desc:0 "Now that I have dealt with slave masters, it seems I have acquired a slave. So it is up to me now... #italic what will happen to him?#!"
 agot_hunt_activity.007.a:0 "I shall free him!"
 agot_hunt_activity.007.b:0 "He shall join my court."
 agot_hunt_activity.007.c:0 "His life is mine to end!"
