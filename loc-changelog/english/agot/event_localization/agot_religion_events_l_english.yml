 agot_religion_events.0700.desc:0 "It is time to gather the supplies and funds necessary to launch my whaling expedition."
 agot_religion_events.0700.a:0 "I will spend generously on this expedition."
 agot_religion_events.0700.b:0 "I will invest moderate funds."
 agot_religion_events.0700.c:0 "I will spend the bare minimum."

 agot_religion_events.0701.t:0 "Whaling Expedition"
 agot_religion_events.0701.desc_great:0 "After only a few short hours of scouring the sea, I am alerted to a few whales breaching nearby. Though I am a considerable distance away, I can see that they are all the size of small islands. At least, that's what I'll be telling the traders back on shore.\n\nRegardless, my sailors and I can plainly see that they are worth a small fortune!"
 agot_religion_events.0701.desc_good:0 "A sudden shout from one of my sailors grabs my attention.\n\nI follow the growing shouts, turned heads, and outstretched fingers, and eventually I see a whale thrashing about in the distance. From what I can see, it is one that is likely to fetch a good price..."
 agot_religion_events.0701.desc_bad:0 "The expedition has dragged on for far too long. My sailors groan and whine that we haven't seen any sign of a whale and that we will probably never see one at this rate.\n\nThough their laziness wounds me, I fear they are right. This expedition is a waste, and my coffers have been robbed by my own ambition!"
 agot_religion_events.0701.a:0 "I must chase after them!"
 agot_religion_events.0701.b:0 "It shall be mine!"
 agot_religion_events.0701.c:0 "Damnation!"

 agot_religion_events.0800.desc:0 "[recipient.GetName] looms ahead, menacing and ominous. Though [recipient.Custom('DragonSheHe')] has not yet noticed me, it is still thrilling to confront a living and breathing god.\n\nI move the food crates ahead, dragging them into a clearing so that [recipient.GetNameNoTooltip] can see it in all of its splendor.\n\nI step behind the food and prepare to attract the dragon's attention."
 agot_religion_events.0800.a:0 "[recipient.GetNameNoTooltip]! I am here!"
 agot_religion_events.0800.b:0 "On second thought, I should get out of here."

 agot_religion_events.0900.t:0 "Homage to the Others"
 agot_religion_events.0900.desc:0 "There are horrors in this world that we must respect. As a devotee of [ROOT.Char.GetFaith.GetName], I recognize that the Others are among those horrors and that their wrath may be quelled with a sacrifice.\n\nI collect [recipient.GetName] and descend into the night, ready to sacrifice [recipient.GetHerHim] to the Others with the hope they accept my tribute as a showing of my obedience."
 agot_religion_events.0900.a:0 "This must be done."

 agot_religion_events.1000.t: "A Visceral Call"
 agot_religion_events.1000.desc.holy_site: "Before me stands a colossal obelisk of oily black stone, its smooth surface reflecting a muted, ageless power. In its silent vigil, hints of forgotten mysteries stir.\n\nPeople across time have taken pieces as trophies, and others have built monuments. Here, a natural obelisk stands—but what mysteries may lie within? What must I sacrifice?"
 agot_religion_events.1000.desc.artifact: "In my hand rests a fragment of oily black stone, its smooth surface reflecting a muted, ageless power. As I gaze into the stone in my hand, hints of forgotten mysteries stir.\n\nAcross the ages great monuments have been hewn from this stone, and oily black obelisks rise where none should stand. Others before me have carried fragments like this—but what mysteries may lie within? What must I sacrifice?"
 agot_religion_events.1000.a: "A glorious offering"
 agot_religion_events.1000.a.tt: "I place something of great value before this oily stone, seeking to appease whatever power it may hold. Such a gift may attract... attention."
 agot_religion_events.1000.b: "A humble tribute"
 agot_religion_events.1000.b.tt: "A more modest offering, still meaningful, but not as extravagant. Perhaps enough to stir the stone's interest without arousing its wrath."
 agot_religion_events.1000.c: "Nothing, but myself"
 agot_religion_events.1000.c.tt: "Instead of material wealth, I lay my own will at the stone's mercy, seeking understanding—or madness. What will the stone demand in return?"
 agot_religion_events.1000.d: "Leave it be"
 agot_religion_events.1000.d.tt: "The stone remains undisturbed. Its power is undeniable, but perhaps the time is not yet right for such an offering—or perhaps it’s wiser to ignore it altogether."

 agot_religion_events.1001.t: "The Ritual"
 agot_religion_events.1001.desc.start_no_offering: "I stand before the stone, giving nothing but my own presence. It feels as though the stone itself is drawing me in, weighing my decision."
 agot_religion_events.1001.desc.start_offering: "I set my offering before the stone, an act of reverence. The stone seems almost to acknowledge my gesture, as though awaiting something more."
 agot_religion_events.1001.desc: "\n\nI begin a ritual of focused intent, the stone, the feeling of the oily smoothness, now at the center of my thoughts. Each gesture, each word spoken or thought, feels deliberate, as though the act itself holds the power to shape what comes next."

 agot_religion_events.1001.desc.end_no_change: "\n\nAs I turn and walk away from the stone, I feel unchanged with the stone silent behind me. There’s a quiet disappointment, as though the effort was for nothing, but I can’t shake the feeling that something was still left unsaid."
 agot_religion_events.1001.desc.end_changed: "\n\nAs I turn and walk away from the stone, I feel something has shifted within me. It’s hard to say what, but I can feel the change, lingering just beneath the surface."
 agot_religion_events.1001.shrewd: "Sharper mind"
 agot_religion_events.1001.shrewd.tt: "The stone has left me with a keener sense of strategy. I find myself thinking more clearly, anticipating the moves of others with unsettling precision."
 agot_religion_events.1001.strong: "Unyielding strength"
 agot_religion_events.1001.strong.tt: "The stone has granted me a surge of physical might. I feel more capable, my body now a more formidable force than it was before."
 agot_religion_events.1001.good: "A gift from the stone"
 agot_religion_events.1001.good.tt: "Whatever the stone has done, it has brought something positive. Perhaps newfound wisdom, or an unexpected advantage in my path ahead."
 agot_religion_events.1001.no_change_tt: "The stone has done nothing. My hopes and expectations are dashed, leaving me to question if it was all for nothing."
 agot_religion_events.1001.bad: "A price paid"
 agot_religion_events.1001.bad.tt: "Whatever change has come, it has cost me dearly. The stone may have given me something, but it has taken just as much in return."

 agot_religion_events.1001.possessed: "A voice in the dark"
 agot_religion_events.1001.possessed.tt: "I feel something stirring within, an alien presence taking root in my mind. The stone’s power seems to have claimed me in ways I cannot explain."
 agot_religion_events.1001.no_change.zealous: "Why do the gods hate me?"
 agot_religion_events.1001.no_change.zealous.tt: "I feel as though the gods have rejected me, their favor slipping further from my grasp. I am left frustrated and confused, seeking answers where there are none."
 agot_religion_events.1001.no_change: "Unanswered"
 agot_religion_events.1001.no_change.tt: "The stone has done nothing. My hopes and expectations are dashed, leaving me to question if it was all for nothing."

 agot_religion_events.4000.desc:0 "My counselors and traders have been whispering about untapped markets in distant lands. After careful consideration, I have decided to propose a grand trade expedition to my court. This venture could bring immense wealth to my realm, but it could also just be a useless waste of resources. As the council assembles to discuss my plan, I must now decide how much to invest in the journey."
