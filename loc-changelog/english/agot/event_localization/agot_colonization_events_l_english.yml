In the twilight light, we made camp on the edge of a copse of stout trees and set to work starting a campfire. Despite the lack of comfort, I feel a calmness descending on me as I take in the beauty of the star-studded sky.\n\nSuddenly, I hear a snarl. Across from the fire, I see a pair of eyes. Just as suddenly, the pair are joined by two dozen others, and I realize that we are surrounded. A cruel howl strikes our ears, and our error becomes clear — we have camped beside a wolf den!

As we approach, our fear grows, for the she-wolf stands before a scrabbling pile of wolf-cubs, and her snarl and snap make it clear that she means to defend them with all her strength and ferocity."

The wolves, they say, are so numerous and terrible that merely surviving the nights is a challenge. The situation is unsustainable.\n\nAs my retinue and I prepare to return home to gather a force to cull the wolves, I get separated from the rest of my group with only a small handful of people. Before long, the quiet gloom of the night is shattered by the howls of what must be at least a hundred wolves.

A little extra caution is ordinarily all that is required, and even the more inquisitive beasts can usually be deterred by the vigorous clanging of cooking pans.\n\nOne bear is different. Known as 'Yoh-gi' in the local dialect, he is smarter than the average bear, stalking work parties and attacking them whenever they pause for a meal. As soon as the workers scatter, he raids their baggage for supplies, stealing any food they have brought with them.\n\nThere is considerable debate in the settlement as to how to deal with the problem. The colony has employed rangers, who wish to mount an expedition against the bear. However, the settlement's smith believes the bear can be lured into an ingenious trap of his own design, baited with a honey-laden beehive."

After a short struggle, the bear collapses, twitching. With her last strength, she looks into my eyes again with an expression that seems almost... pleading. Disconcerted, I step back and drop the spear.\n\nIt is then that I hear the mewling.\n\nAt the back of the cave, I find the source of the noise — a tiny cub, still blind and feeble, crawls towards me.

What was at first only a number of isolated gangs of thugs and brigands has, over time, started to consolidate under the command of a select few bosses.

But upon arrival, I am met under the flag of truce. The leaders of the Brotherhood step out to meet with me and present an offer.

 agot_colonization_events.1401.desc:0 "The marshy terrain around our new colony in [obstacle_province.GetName] has proven beneficial in many ways. For one, it is easily defendable, as the approaches are difficult for any large body of men. For another, the fenlands are teeming with bream, perch, pike, and eels, which my settlers can catch fresh or smoke for winter.\n\nOn the other hand, the marshes present a formidable threat of flooding, particularly during the spring thaw when the marshland islets can be overwhelmed by rising waters. To defend against this, my settlers have begun work on a system of dykes and channels to protect their homes and drain land for agriculture. This requires an enormous amount of labor and has proven a difficult burden for the nascent colony. Now, it seems one of the dykes has been breached, and floodwaters threaten to destroy the settlement altogether."

 agot_colonization_events.1402.desc:0 "My marshland settlement in [obstacle_province.GetName] is often inundated during the spring floods, but the threat is slowly receding as a system of levees is completed to hold back and divert the rising tides.\n\nYet the colony remains afflicted by a mysterious ailment, seemingly brought on by the biting insects that swarm above the waters. This ague brings fever, shivering, and terrible fatigue.\n\nThe colonists have now written, demanding supplies of willow bark to relieve their suffering and mugwort to deter the insects."
 agot_colonization_events.1402.a:0 "They shall get what they need."
 agot_colonization_events.1402.b:0 "It's about time the clergy provided some charity here..."
