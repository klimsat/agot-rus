 agot_nights_watch.0004.desc:0 "Today didn't start normally. The Wall outposts creaked, the trees close to us ruffled and shook — #N something is wrong.#!\n\nAs all of the black brothers worried, one ranger runs to me through the crowd. #bold "Our Wall is being breached!"#! he shouts.\n\nLooking outward, beyond the Wall, the sway and sly movements of trees can be seen. Rumors oft say Wildlings and giants are coming, considered drunken japes and the talk of weak men until now...\n\nThe Wildlings swarm through the breach like roaches from a rotting sack of grain when exposed to light, only my stomach turns more so at this sight. #bold For thousands of years the Wall had not failed, we cannot let our Watch be the one it does.#!"

 agot_nights_watch.0026.desc:0 "It has been but a few days since my predecessor's watch ended, a few days to ponder over many a thought.\n\nHave my brothers in command truly serviced the watch to their utmost ability? Have they shown clear skill and rational thinking? Or has their resolve laxed, and skill left to idle? While such brothers have enjoyed their positions of importance, many younger men have shown great promise and intellect.\n\nAs Lord Commander it is my duty to make sure the watch remains in capable hands, even if that may entail some of those hands changing."

The institution of the men of the [nightswatch.GetName] is an ancient and venerable order that is held in high regard by [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetCollectiveNoun], and it is not completely unheard of for an older lord to forsake their lands and titles for the betterment of the realm and their holdings..."
