 agot_titans_march.0001.desc:0 "How could this be? [daena.GetFirstName], my sister, my blood, has brought a bastard into the world, borne of her sins when she last escaped the Maidenvault. She has named the child [daemon.GetFirstName], but refuses to reveal the father.\n\nI have prayed for strength, for wisdom to guide me in this dark hour, but my prayers seem to go unanswered. The child's very existence seems a mockery of the purity I have so desperately sought. How can I remain the Blessed King when my own flesh and blood have succumbed to such weakness?\n\nI must be strong. For this child is but one among many trials that the Seven place before me. Perhaps the gods have seen fit to test me once more. I must find a way to redeem us all from this stain."

 agot_titans_march.0100.desc:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNicknamed] has breathed his last. The king is dead, and the Iron Throne now stands vacant. By right, it should pass to [daena.GetFirstName], the eldest living child of [egg3.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal]. However, [daena.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is a wild and untamed and may be ill-suited for ruling. Her sisters could present a more measured choice: [rhaena.GetFirstName] is sweet and devout, and [elaena.GetFirstName] is sharp-witted and practical.\n\nYet, the girls have spent much of their lives in the Maidenvault, and it is possible that none of them would be able to rule effectively. Should their claims be set aside, the next in line would be [viserys.GetFirstName], who has proven himself a capable Hand, managing the realm through the reigns of three kings.\n\nWho will rise to fill the empty throne?"

 agot_titans_march.0301.desc:0 "My sister [daena.GetFirstName] has escaped the Maidenvault once again — this time, she has vanished with her son, [daemon.GetFirstName]. No one knows where she has gone, and there is no trace left behind. I fear that this time, she may not return. The shame of her actions stains our house, and I am powerless to stop her.\n\nHow many times must I endure this madness? The people whisper of her defiance, and my patience wears thin. Yet, my heart aches at the thought of her, lost somewhere in the world with the child that may very well carry her rebellious blood. My sister's flight is a curse that follows us both, and I wonder if I shall ever see her again."

 agot_titans_march.0302.desc:0 "I am free at last. The Maidenvault, that gilded prison, can no longer contain me. I have taken my son, [daemon.GetFirstName], and escaped its confining walls.

This is no mere place of worship; it is a monument to everything I have endeavored to embody: the devotion, the piety, and the unwavering love for the Seven that has guided me through every trial.\n\nYet, as I stand here, I cannot help but reflect on my journey — the countless moments I have strived to live as the gods would have me, and the many times I have faltered. Can I truly live up to this name, to the immense expectations now bound to this sacred place? Will I, in time, become the man worthy of such a legacy?"

 agot_titans_march.0402.desc:0 "The grand sept upon Visenya's Hill is finally complete.

A fitting tribute to a king who sought only the favor of the gods, yet tragically never lived to witness this day. His vision, his dream, has become a reality, but he is no longer here to bask in its glory.\n\nAs I stand before it, I cannot help but think of Baelor — the man he was, and the ruler he sought to become. His purity, his unshakable faith, and his deep devotion to the Seven — qualities that both elevated him and, in the eyes of many, led to his downfall."

 agot_titans_march.1000.desc:0 "It seems our pride has been shattered. The defeat in the Third Braavosi-Pentoshi War left us with no choice but to seek a new opportunity to regain our strength. We turned our eyes to the Stepstones, a collection of islands ripe for conquest. Yet, despite our efforts, the campaign ended in failure, and we were forced to pull out.\n\nNow, [GetTitleByKey('k_braavos').GetNameNoTier], ever watchful, has seen our retreat as a sign of weakness. They strike now, with an invasion born of the very same pride we once held. Our foes are emboldened by our misstep, and we are left with the consequences of our own overreach."

We expanded our military further, preparing ourselves for what might come next. Meanwhile, [GetTitleByKey('k_pentos').GetNameNoTier], eager to assert its power, turned its eyes toward the Stepstones, attempting to secure a foothold in those vital islands.\n\nBut their ambition has faltered. The campaign was a failure, and their retreat from the Stepstones is now a glaring sign of weakness. The moment to strike is upon us — this is the opportunity we've been waiting for, and we will not let it pass."

 agot_titans_march.3000.desc:0 "My father spent his final years dreaming of restoring an ancient Andal kingdom, a vision he pursued with relentless determination. Yet, before he could see it realized, death claimed him, leaving his ambition unfinished. But I will not let his dream die with him. I will finish what he started.\n\nThe war between [GetTitleByKey('k_braavos').GetNameNoTier] and [GetTitleByKey('k_pentos').GetNameNoTier] rages on, a conflict that has already reshaped the balance of power in the region. This could be the perfect opportunity to seize the advantage and expand our influence. If I act wisely, we could use this chaos to gain the power my father sought to restore."

 agot_titans_march.4000.desc:0 "I was once the Sealord of [GetTitleByKey('k_braavos').GetNameNoTier], secure in my station and trusted by my people. But in the shadows, betrayal festered. [sealord.GetTitledFirstName] — my fleet admiral I had trusted implicitly — struck when I least expected it. With the cold steel of treachery, he led a coup that saw me cast down, his own ambition propelling him to the seat of Sealord. The city I once called home is now his to command.\n\nI escaped with nothing but my life and three dragon eggs once sold to Braavos. The eggs may hold the promise of power, but for now, they are a fragile reminder of what I've lost.\n\nThe world is cruel, and Braavos no longer has a place for me. But I will not be forgotten."

In the wrong hands, they could be a devastating force, but they are also a powerful bargaining chip.

All the better if Pentos is able to leverage the eggs in their wars against Braavos."

 agot_titans_march.4002.desc:0 "The ex-Sealord of Braavos, now a shadow of his former self, has written me with a curious proposition. He offers to sell me three dragon eggs — rare and powerful treasures that could turn the tide of any conflict. I know better than to trust a man who once held the reins of Braavos's power, but the opportunity to acquire such a rare gift cannot be ignored. What is his true intent? Perhaps it's a chance to strike at Braavos's heart, or simply a way to gain an advantage."

He believes these eggs are worth less than I do, or perhaps he simply seeks to take advantage of my position. Still, it is not an offer to dismiss outright. The eggs remain a powerful bargaining chip, and I must decide if his terms are acceptable."

 agot_titans_march.5000.desc:0 "War greeted us home after our strategic withdrawal from the Stepstones, orchestrated by none other than the biggest thorn on Pentos' side, a Sealord of Braavos. A foolish mistake if there ever was one. Our thoroughly experienced veterans, hardened from their time down south, marched to halt their incursion into our lands. Where they expected to find nothing more than a rugged band of exhausted conscripts to sluggardly throw themselves on their blades, attritioned by years of strife with pirates and the likes, firmly stood the Prince's men.\n\nThey had thought us weak, but we held our ground and pushed the so-called self-proclaimed "liberators" out of Andalos. Now that the dust has settled, we once more stand as its uncontested hegemon."
