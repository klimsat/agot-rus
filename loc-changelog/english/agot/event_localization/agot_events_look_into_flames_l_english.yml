 agot_look_into_flames.0007.desc:0 "Mesmerized by the flickering flames, smoke and whirls of fire begin to take shape, and for the briefest of moments the blessed fire reveals strange symbols — forming, flickering, and melting into one another, as if shadows themselves danced before me.\n\nAs quickly as they appeared, they melt away, and the flames are nothing more than an ordinary fire once more."
