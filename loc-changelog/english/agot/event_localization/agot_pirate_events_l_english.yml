 agot_pirate_events.9201.desc:0 ""My liege," [colonist.GetName] says with a weary sigh, "This land was made for pirates and reavers, not farmers and merchants. The soil is thin, the coast is dangerous, and pirates still haunt the waters and hills. I cannot make it prosper without your aid — and even then, I fear it may never be worth the cost."\n\nIf I give aid, I can keep these lands under my rule, but will the cost ever pay off if it is as barren as [colonist.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] claims? Still, it is my duty as liege to support my vassals in their need, and if I fail in that duty, there is no telling how long they will remain loyal, or even remain vassals at all."
