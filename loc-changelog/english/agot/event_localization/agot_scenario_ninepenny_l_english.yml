 agot_ninepenny.0001.t:0 "The Band of Nine"
 agot_ninepenny.0001.desc:0 ""Each of us shall carve out a kingdom onto ourselves," [adarys.GetName] proclaims, beneath the great Tree of Crowns in the Disputed Lands. My birthright will be hard-won — even wresting control of the Golden Company was no easy feat. Now, before me kneel nine of the most heinous outlaws in Essos... The type of support only one known as [ROOT.Char.GetNickname] could secure.\n\nWith [saan.GetNickname], [old_mother.GetFirstNameNicknamed], [butcher.GetNickname], [bad_apple.GetNickname], [nine_eyes.GetNickname], [ebon_prince.GetNickname], and [lashare.GetNickname] at my back... The Iron Throne will be mine. But [ROOT.Char.Custom('BlackfyreRebellions')|l] will require careful measure, as my next steps will surely send ripples that will reach the small council of the Seven Kingdoms. #bold I must make haste, lest my enemies bring the war to me.#!"
 agot_ninepenny.0001.a:0 "We will install the Silvertongue in Tyrosh."
 agot_ninepenny.0001.b:0 "I have no time for this. We will take the Stepstones, then on to Westeros!"
 agot_ninepenny.0001.b.alt:0 "Old Mother shall take the Stepstones."
 agot_ninepenny.0001.c:0 "The pirate wants Lys? Then he'll have it!"
 agot_ninepenny.0001.d:0 "Lashare will claim Myr."
 agot_ninepenny.0001.e:0 "Nine Eyes will have Pentos."
 agot_ninepenny.0001.f:0 "It is time to claim my birthright!"
 agot_ninepenny.0001.g:0 "I'm sick of this."

 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.tyrosh:0 "With Tyrosh in the capable hands of my ally [adarys.GetNameNicknamed], the Band of Nine becomes ever stronger. A worthy prize in my eyes: [daemon.GetFirstNameNicknamed] once called Tyrosh home, and Blackfyre support will not be hard to come by with a new tyrant — erm, archon.\n\nFortune favors the bold, and I must make my next move with haste. The lords of Westeros have doubtless heard rumor of my menace."
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.lys:0 "A pirate's lands for a pirate king: No one is better suited to rule Lys the Lovely than [saan.GetNameNicknamed]. The wealth of the city will greatly support my cause, as well — and who can resist a visit to the Perfumed Garden to relieve the stress of war.\n\nBut time is of the essence, and I must make my next move with haste. News of the Band of Nine's exploits will have surely reached Westeros by now."
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.pentos:0 "Conquering Pentos for my ally [nine_eyes.GetNameNicknamed] will be a great boon for the Band of Nine: a valuable port directly across the Narrow Sea from King's Landing — and my birthright. The city proved to be as vulnerable as tales made jest.\n\nA faint heart never won a fair lady, and my prize is far greater than a mere dame. I must make quick action, riding this momentum to my kingdom."
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.myr:0 "Myr is an exalted prize for [lashare.GetNameNicknamed], and his rule will embolden the Band of Nine: Though matters of art and learning are of little interest to me, the Sea of Myrth provides a strategic foothold en route to Westeros.\n\nOur power grows, but so does our peril. The Seven Kingdoms could bring their collective might against my motley alliance at any moment."
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc.stepstones:0 "With the Band of Nine now holding the Stepstones, I am now within striking distance from the Iron Throne — a powerful position to hold, and yet vulnerable to maintain. My enemies will no doubt take note of the growing Blackfyre Host, so I must be prepared for an attack at any moment if I don't move on the Seven Kingdoms myself.\n\nMy birthright is so close, I can taste it... The metallic tang of blood and iron... My destiny, the dream of the Black Dragon, awaits."
 agot_ninepenny.0002.desc:0 "With the untimely death of [claimant.GetName] there is little reason for us to continue a war for a dead [claimant.GetWomanMan]. We shall move our attention to more pressing matters.\n\nHow did we get here, exactly? We all look around, each of the Band of Nine as baffled as the next. Well, why don't we do a little war?"

 agot_ninepenny.0003.desc:0 "#bold The Iron Throne is now mine!#!\n\nYears after my grandfather was spurned by the pretender-king, Daeron the Falseborn, a Blackfyre at last sits rightfully upon the seat of the Seven Kingdoms. Yet there are those in my realm who will doubt my legitimacy; it behooves me to do all I can to tighten my grip around the neck of Westeros.\n\nIf I were to take a Targaryen bride, none would doubt the lineage of our children. The existence of a husband is an issue... but not one insurmountable."
 agot_ninepenny.0003.a:0 "I shall take my new bride."
 agot_ninepenny.0003.b:0 "I rather like the look of this one."

 agot_ninepenny.0004.desc:0 "In Essos, the ragtag alliance of pirates and mercenaries known as the Band of the Nine have increasingly found success at a worrying rate... [councillor.GetName] tells me that this [maelys.GetTitledFirstNameNicknamedRegnal], as he calls himself, may prove a greater threat than initially imagined — emboldened by the success enjoyed by him and his court of upjumped sellswords and cutthroats."
 agot_ninepenny.0004.a:0 "A preemptive strike will be best."
 agot_ninepenny.0004.a.tt:0 "You will call the banners against the Blackfyre pretender and his allies."

 agot_ninepenny.0008.desc:0 "The thick of the battle is where I feel #bold alive#!. Unlike any hapless whelp who happens to fall in my path. A single swing of my sword cleaves an enemy soldier cleanly in half... well, cleanly but for the #bold blood#!.\n\nAhead of me, in a small opening between the vanguard and the rear, I spot him: [baratheon.GetFullNameNicknamed], the stag on his banner clearly of House [baratheon.GetHouse.GetName]. Such an opponent will be easy work for me, and the Targaryen pretenders will be furious if I kill a stag such as him.\n\n[location.GetName] will be [baratheon.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] end."
 agot_ninepenny.0008.a:0 "Prepare yourself, stag."

 agot_ninepenny.0009.t:0 "The Monster and the Stag"
 agot_ninepenny.0009.desc:0 "The ebb and flow of battle is much like a storm — the crash of swords and shields against one another like claps of thunder. Men around me fall to the ground, their fates sealed by the blade.\n\nAhead of me, I watch a soldier cloven in two, blood and entrails spraying forth, revealing his attacker: A countenance straight from the hells, [maelys.GetFullNameNicknamed]. He clearly sees me from across the small opening before us, and he begins a frenzied rush toward me.\n\nI raise my [baratheon.Custom('SignatureWeaponNameOrType')], and pray the Warrior gives me strength."
 agot_ninepenny.0009.a:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetMotto]."

 agot_ninepenny.0013.t:0 "The Wheat Knight"
 agot_ninepenny.0013.desc:0 "My lobstered fist recoils from the red mist that was once the man's face. I toss aside the knight in livery of wheat and fill my lungs with the sulfer of raging battle. Let the next man to try and slay the rightful king come.\n\nI hear a bellow, and before me there's a blur of steel, cutting through men wearing my badge. At last, I may have a #bold worthy challenge#!."
 agot_ninepenny.0013.a:0 "This wheat knight shall be threshed..."

 agot_ninepenny.0014.t:0 "The Pretender"
 agot_ninepenny.0014.desc:0 "One does not come by the epithet [selmy.GetNickname] — bestowed by a prince, no less — without merit. My command of the battlefield is unparalleled, cutting a bloody path through the pretender's soldiers like a scythe slicing through ripe wheat stalks.\n\nBefore me, I can see my enemy, one with a nickname to match my own: [maelys.GetNickname]. It is time to live up to my legend... It is time #bold to kill god's mistake#!."
 agot_ninepenny.0014.a:0 "May the Warrior give me strength."

 agot_ninepenny.0020.desc:0 "Not a moment after I've taken my seat atop the Iron Throne, [spokesperson.GetFirstNameNicknamed] approaches, avarice gleaming in [spokesperson.GetHerHis] eye.\n\n"Now that you've got your precious kingdom, Your Grace," [spokesperson.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] says, almost sneering, "will you uphold your vow to help each of us carve out kingdoms of our own?""

No sooner than our swords are sheathed will our enemies move against us.\n\n[ninepenny_king.GetFirstNameNicknamed] approaches with [ninepenny_king.GetHerHis] desire to claim a kingdom of [ninepenny_king.GetHerHis] own — and with the strength of the Seven Kingdoms behind me, I intend to give it to [ninepenny_king.GetHerHim]."
