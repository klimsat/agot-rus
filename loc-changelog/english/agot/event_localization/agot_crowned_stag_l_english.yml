 agot_crowned_stag.0001.desc:0 "After a bloody struggle and the loss of my beloved Lyanna, we have prevailed against the tyranny of the Mad King. The last Targaryens and their treacherous ilk are banished across the Narrow Sea. I now stand as Westeros' rightful king.\n\nAll hail Robert, the First of his Name, King of the Andals, the Rhoynar, and the First Men, Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm!"
 agot_crowned_stag.0001.a:0 "Ours Is the Fury!"

 agot_crowned_stag.0002.t:0 "Royal Duties: Desires"
 agot_crowned_stag.0002.desc:0 "It is a hard task being king. Meeting with petitioners, sitting idle for hours in council meetings, hearing the same prattling voices tell me about issues of little to no consequence. Sheep tract rights here, shipping lanes with Myr there. There's no glory in it, no excitement. My blood never rises like it used to — by the #italic Gods#! how it used to thunder when I hefted my hammer. How much I yearn to feel alive again.\n\nSince there's no battle to be had anymore, perhaps I should explore the other, more sensual avenue of release. I hear the Street of Silk offers exactly that..."
 agot_crowned_stag.0002.a:0 "By the #bold Gods#!, I need a woman!"
 agot_crowned_stag.0002.b:0 "I will not stoop so low."

 agot_crowned_stag.0003.t:0 "Royal Duties: Relief"
 agot_crowned_stag.0003.desc:0 "It's past dusk when I enter the brothel, but even in the lowlight I can tell the women seem welcoming and comely enough. Before long, one approaches me and offers a kind smile."\n\n"Welcome, my lord," she says. "I am [prostitute_character.GetFirstName]. How can I be of service?"\n\nWithin an hour she's gotten me drunk, the light buzz in my belly making the steps towards the stairs easy enough to do without much thinking. This is exactly what I had in mind. It isn't #italic quite#! like a battle, but it'll do. It'll do for now... "
 agot_crowned_stag.0003.a:0 "Finally, some relief..."
 agot_crowned_stag.0003.a.tt:0 "You lay with [prostitute_character.GetFirstName]"

 agot_crowned_stag.1000.t:0 "Night Gathers"
 agot_crowned_stag.1000.desc:0 "Benjen approaches me quietly, his face drawn and solemn. "You have a proper heir now, and soon enough, there will likely be more. You don't need me anymore."\n\n"Benjen—" "I would ask for your leave to join the Night's Watch," he interrupts me firmly. "Ned, I can't stay in Winterfell. Father, Brandon, Lya... maybe you can build a new family and find happiness here, but all I see are their ghosts. I keep wondering if I could have done something differently, maybe..."\n\nThe broken grief in his face hardens into determination. "The Night's Watch always needs recruits. I could do good there."
 agot_crowned_stag.1000.a:0 "If you feel you must."
 agot_crowned_stag.1000.b:0 "I cannot bear to lose another family member."
