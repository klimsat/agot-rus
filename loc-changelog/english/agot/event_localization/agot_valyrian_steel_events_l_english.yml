The blade is as pale as the full moon forged from the heart of a fallen star covered by a dark ornate sheath; her pommel is shaped as a golden sun glows in the morning's light. This is where Dawn remains when there is no Sword of the Morning, where she rests in between bouts of fame and glory. \n\nThe granting of Dawn to a Dayne worthy of bearing her is an ancient responsibility, which now falls to me. I must select a worthy knight to live up to the standards of our ancestors. \nOver the last few years, it has come to my attention that [my_relation.GetFirstName] has grown into a talented and honorable knight — but are they worthy of becoming the next #S Sword of the Morning? #!"

I turn it over in my hands and break the purple wax button to open the letter. \n\nIt seems that [my_relation.GetFirstName] would name me to be the next #SSword of the Morning#!, if I would accept the honor. So many great Daynes have borne that fabled blade, like Lord Davos Dayne, who fought against King Yorick V Yronwood and his armies for his future wife, Princess Nymeria. These figures have brought glory to our House. Am I truly worthy to follow in their footsteps?"
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.a:0 "I will accept the calling."
 agot_valyrian_steel.0002.b:0 "I am no Sword of the Morning."

 agot_valyrian_steel.0004.desc:0 "With the death of [dead_relative.GetFirstName], the mantle of Sword of the Morning stands empty. Once the funeral rites are over and [dead_relative.GetHerHim] is resting with the Seven Who Are One; Dawn will return to her pedestal to await a new bearer. There have been years of our history where the title has remained vacant as there has been no worthy candidate. \n\nHowever, another of our House may be worthy of the title Sword of the Morning and the honors and duties that come with it. [my_relative.GetFirstName] has demonstrated exceptional talent thus far and proven themselves a man of honor. Perhaps they are even worthy of becoming the next #S Sword of the Morning? #!"

Slain during the Ride of the Seven, charging to the defense of the doomed Prince Joffrey. He is the great honor of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetName], and the subject of innumerable songs — yet his loss was also that of the ancestral Valyrian steel sword Lamentation.\n\nIt has not been seen for many years, but I know in my heart there must be a trail to unearth.

A reclamation scheme to unearth the bones of men and women and beasts who died in screaming terror. It will be an arduous task, and may produce nothing at all.
