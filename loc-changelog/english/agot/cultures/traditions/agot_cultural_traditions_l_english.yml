 #Traditions
 tradition_agot_blackwater_bay_name:0 "Domain of the Crown"
 tradition_agot_blackwater_bay_desc:0 "The Crownlands are the newest of the regions of Westeros, forged by the houses and peoples sworn directly to the Iron Throne. As a result, they have taken on its characteristics and ways of life. Dominated by the city of King's Landing, more and more people are beginning to live in cities and adopt more urban styles of living."

 tradition_agot_vale_andal_heritage_name:0 "Faith and Fury"
 tradition_agot_vale_andal_heritage_desc:0 "The Andals hail from Northern Essos, though none know precisely where. With the continued expansion of the land-hungry Valyrian Freehold, the Andals were forced to flee from their native homelands to Westeros, sweeping over everywhere south of the Neck and bringing their religious fervor and traditions of knighthood and chivalry along with them."

 tradition_agot_valeman_finger_name:0 "Humble Service"
 tradition_agot_valeman_finger_desc:0 "The Fingers are a dreary, windswept place, so assailed by the winds from the frigid north that little vegetation grows near their tips. There is little living to be made for the smallfolk beyond herding grazing animals, as there's scant land to make usable cropland. Thus, the Fingermen live modest lives, and the goatherds and sharecroppers find some contentment in their unforgiving home."

 tradition_agot_honeywiner_name:0 "Soft and Sweet"
 tradition_agot_honeywiner_desc:0 "The men of the Honeywine and its surrounding lands are some of the most prosperous in all Westeros. With fertile lands and the great city of Oldtown, much trade flows through the river that gives the people their name. With the Citadel and Starry Sept, the area is a bastion of learning in Westeros, with even many smallfolk being lettered."

 tradition_agot_valeman_upper_name:0 "High Above"
 tradition_agot_valeman_upper_desc:0 "Set apart from their kin who make their homes in the Vale's fertile valleys, the men who dwell in the heights of the Mountains of the Moon are a far more rugged, stalwart folk. In times of war, it is they who man the first lines of defense against outside incursions, and with their lives at high altitude, it is also they who must deal most with incursions from the Mountain Clansmen."

 tradition_agot_reachman_name:0 "Greenhand's Glory"
 tradition_agot_reachman_desc:0 "The Reach is a prosperous and fertile land built on the backs of hardworking smallfolk. It is also a land of families with some of the oldest roots in Westeros, dating back to the mythical Garth Greenhand, from whom most prominent Reachmen families claim descent. With so many families striving for prominence in a wealthy land, the ties that bind them are stronger and more important than elsewhere in Westeros."

 tradition_agot_riverlands_name:0 "Rewards of the River"
 tradition_agot_riverlands_desc:0 "The Rivermen are a people often caught between the powers around them, yet they tend to thrive when they have a strong king of their own. The Trident and its tributaries define their lives more than anything else, and from these waters they prosper."

 tradition_agot_shieldman_name:0 "Guarding the Mander"
 tradition_agot_shieldman_desc:0 "Named after their primary function as a shield against Ironborn attacks, the Shield Isles are a collective of four well-fortified islands of the Reach, overseen by four separate houses. A loyal (although arguably isolated) people, those of the Shield Isles are known for their hardy temperaments and sense of duty. The islands are famous for their beacons, which elders in watchtowers light island by island to spread warnings of incoming longships to inland settlements. Above all else, those from the Shield Isles value themselves as a first line of naval defense."

 tradition_agot_stormlands_name:0 "Like Unto Their Weather"
 tradition_agot_stormlands_desc:0 "The Stormlanders are a hardy bunch, well known for their martial inclinations and their quickness to anger. The men and women of the Stormlands have weathered the wrath of men, nature, and even the gods themselves, and yet they not only remain, but prosper."

 tradition_agot_marches_name:0 "Wars Beyond Count"
 tradition_agot_marches_desc:0 "The Marches have long been the crossroads of the Stormlands, the Reach, and Dorne, witnessing countless battles since the Dawn Age. The people who call them home are known for their martial skill, fierce stubbornness, and constant alertness to all would-be threats."

 tradition_agot_stone_dornish_name:0 "Guarding the Passes"
 tradition_agot_stone_dornish_desc:0 "The Stone Dornish are ethnically and culturally the least Rhoynar-influenced of the Dornish. Living in the heights and valleys of the Red Mountains, their culture has been shaped by their generations of conflict with the Marcher lords of the Reach and Stormlands, ardently defending their mountain passes from outside incursions."

 tradition_agot_vale_name:0 "Mountain and Vale"
 tradition_agot_vale_desc:0 "The old kingdom of the Arryns is dominated by the Mountains of the Moon and the vales that run between them, chiefly the Vale of Arryn. These two features have isolated the peoples east of them from the rest of Westeros and united them."

 tradition_agot_vineman_name:0 "Wine, Women, and Song"
 tradition_agot_vineman_desc:0 "Ever since the coming of Gilbert of the Vines, the men of the Arbor have known but one thing: wine. The vineyards of the Arbor are legendary in Westeros and beyond for the quality wine they produce, and many a merchant and sailor set their anchors in Ryamsport to buy the finest Arbor reds."

 tradition_agot_westerman_name:0 "Of Gold and Silver"
 tradition_agot_westerman_desc:0 "The Westerlands, at first glance, seem like a paltry place; not the largest or most populous of the Seven Kingdoms, it is nevertheless the wealthiest. What it lacks in rolling fields of fertile farmland, it more than makes up for with the bounty of its hills, rich with gold and silver. It is this abundance of valuable minerals that the power of the Westerlands is built upon, and its nobles jealously guard their mines against those who look on, envious of their wealth."

 tradition_agot_north_name:0 "Bound by Bronze and Iron"
 tradition_agot_north_desc:0 "The Northrons, the men and women who call the North their home, are a grim and hardy people. United by the Hungry Wolf thousands of years ago, the peoples are as varied as the lands they call home, and yet all are bound by their ancient oaths."

 tradition_agot_sisterman_name:0 "Beneath the Brine"
 tradition_agot_sisterman_desc:0 "For much of their history, the Sistermen had more in common with the Ironborn than the men of the Vale or North. For millennia, the Sistermen were ruled by their pirate-kings, pillaging along the shores of the Bite to provide for themselves what their windswept isles could not, worshipping strange deities unknown to both the Andals and First Men."

 tradition_agot_ironmen_name:0 "Carved from Pale Wood"
 tradition_agot_ironmen_desc:0 "The Ironmen are a scourge from the seas, yet their influence ebbs and flows like the tides that bring them. At times they are confined solely to their islands in the Sunset Sea; at others, they have spread to the Green Lands and ruled there. However, they always remain united by their ancient ties to the Grey King who dwells below."

 tradition_agot_dorne_rhoynish_heritage_name:0 "Children of the Mother Rhoyne"
 tradition_agot_dorne_rhoynish_heritage_desc:0 "Rhoynish civilization is ancient and illustrious. So deep is the history of the Rhoynar that some credit them with teaching the Andals how to smith and work with iron. Hailing from the city-states along the river Rhoyne, the Rhoynar worship numerous gods of the river and also have a special affinity for all manner of boats, from small fishing vessels to obscene pleasure barges. Rhoynish culture is notably different from that of the Andals, with equal inheritance being the norm for both women and men, and same-sex relations being accepted. The Rhoynar are known for embracing works of art and music, which may be partially why some Rhoynar cultural practices were so quick to catch on when the Rhoyne arrived in Dorne."

 tradition_agot_greenblood_name:0 "Fluvial Orphanage"
 tradition_agot_greenblood_desc:0 "After fleeing Essos and arriving in Dorne, the Orphans of the Greenblood earned their self-imposed titles by refusing to adopt Dornish customs and assimilate, choosing instead to live as the 'orphans' of the river Rhoyne — the river they call 'mother.' The Orphans of the Greenblood and their descendants cling to Rhoynar culture and beliefs, still speaking the Rhoynish Tongue behind closed doors and in secrecy, living on rafts along the river Greenblood from which they take their name."

 tradition_agot_salt_dornish_name:0 "The Blood of Nymeria"
 tradition_agot_salt_dornish_desc:0 "With the most Rhoynar blood flowing through their veins of any Dornishmen, the Salt Dornish live on the more temperate coastlands of Dorne. They carry on many of the egalitarian traditions brought to Dorne by Nymeria and make for fine sailors, with the ports spotting the Dornish coast bringing them much prosperity."

 tradition_agot_sand_dornish_name:0 "Desert and Dune"
 tradition_agot_sand_dornish_desc:0 "Eking out their existence in the harsh desert that they call home, the Sand Dornish are resilient, ruthless people. Their castles and settlements are based around the rare sources of water in their desert homeland, which they ardently defend. They are a naturally daring and adventurous people, with many of the noble houses in the region descending from those brave few who set out on expeditions into the harsh dunes."

 tradition_agot_wildling_name:0 "Ferocious, Savage, and Wild"
 tradition_agot_wildling_desc:0 "Where the majority of peoples and societies progress and grow, there are groups that refuse to bow before progress, what can be seen by the many Wildlings in Westeros. The majority of them are found Beyond the Wall, but there are groups found in the Mountains of the Moon. These tribal groups are fierce, if undeveloped, and can become threats in large numbers."

 tradition_agot_moon_clan_name:0 "Above the Setting Sun"
 tradition_agot_moon_clan_desc:0 "In the depths of the Mountains of the Moon dwell its clansmen, the most savage and uncivilized men anywhere south of the Wall. They are the last true remnants of the First Men in the Vale, their mountainous home protecting them from the onslaught of the Andals, leaving them to continue their primitive ways without much outside intervention."

 tradition_agot_rushlander_name:0 "Where Rivers Meet Hills"
 tradition_agot_rushlander_desc:0 "A culture born on the border of the Vale and the Riverlands, Rushlanders are a hardy people adapted to life in the hills as well as the rivers."

 tradition_agot_harsh_laws_name:0 "Harsh Rule"
 tradition_agot_harsh_laws_desc:0 "Society shapes the laws. History has shown that it's natural for a harsh land to give rise to harsh people, and they, in turn, make harsh laws to rule by."

 tradition_agot_thenn_name:0 "The Last of the First"
 tradition_agot_thenn_desc:0 "Known as the more 'sophisticated' of the free folk by those south of the Wall, the Thenns consider themselves to be the last remaining First Men. The inhabitants of the mountain valley in the Frostfangs interact more with giants than with other cultures but have managed to learn the occasional word or sentence in Common Tongue, despite having never deviated from the Old Tongue they still speak today. Priding themselves in their belief in Magnar, the Thenn are somewhat more disciplined and organized than other free folk, and have managed to amass an impressive bronze armory. While those south of the Wall may consider the Thenn to be savage, they are more than capable, often coming into conflict with the Night's Watch."

 tradition_agot_andalos_name:0 "Hills Under the Stars"
 tradition_agot_andalos_desc:0 "It was to Hugor that the Seven-Who-Are-One anointed upon the hill in Andalos with seven stars and tasked to bring the Andals to Westeros, their divine reward for maintaining the compact with the Seven-Who-Are-One."

 tradition_agot_braavos_name:0 "Freed from the Slavers' Chains"
 tradition_agot_braavos_desc:0 "Unique amongst the Free Cities, Braavos was formed by escaped slaves on their way to Valyria, and thus is made up of peoples from all over the known world and beyond. This has shaped Braavos into a city and nation of many peoples, where one rule reigns above all: 'No man, woman, or child in Braavos will ever be a slave, thrall, or bondsman.'"

 tradition_agot_religious_fc_name:0 "In Search of Religious Purity"
 tradition_agot_religious_fc_desc:0 "The Freehold was a blending of many peoples, from the Valyrians, to the Andals, Rhoynar, Ghiscari, and others, not counting the numerous slaves from beyond its borders. To keep control of such varied peoples, the Dragonlords allowed the worship of all, which was hated by some of the most zealous of their subjects, who left to found their own cities in search of religious purity."

 tradition_agot_three_daughters_name:0 "Caught Between Siblings"
 tradition_agot_three_daughters_desc:0 "When the Freehold fell to the Doom, its empire was broken, with the different cities all striving for dominance. This can be seen most clearly in the Disputed Lands, where Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh all struggle against each other, with the common people trapped between them in their endless conflict."

 tradition_agot_pentos_name:0 "Bred Through the Mingling"
 tradition_agot_pentos_desc:0 "The Pentoshi are a people believed to have been the product of Valyrian settlers and the native Andals who called the region home before, and thus were born the Pentoshi."

 tradition_agot_doom_name:0 "Cloaked by the Doom"
 tradition_agot_doom_desc:0 "The Doom forever changed the world, and it still remains a mystery to this day. Those who escaped the cataclysmic destruction are still cloaked by it to this day."

 tradition_agot_slavers_bay_name:0 "Enthralled by the Trade"
 tradition_agot_slavers_bay_desc:0 "The lifeblood of the Old Empire and even the Freehold was the slave trade. It is from this trade that a people can prosper and grow to build their own future, even if it comes at the cost of another people's freedom."

 tradition_agot_ghis_name:0 "In the Grasp of the Great"
 tradition_agot_ghis_desc:0 "Through discipline and fortitude did the Old Empire of Ghis rise and spread. Despite the use of slaves, the Old Empire was built on the strength of arms of free men in the Lockstep Legions, and so great was their training and order that no other armies of men could stand against them, only dragons and their flames."

 tradition_agot_rhoynar_name:0 "Upon the Mother of Rivers"
 tradition_agot_rhoynar_desc:0 "It is upon the Rhoyne, the great river of western Essos, that one of the great civilizations of the world arose. The Rhoynar are famed for the beauty of their cities and the use and teaching of smelting iron."

 tradition_agot_candling_name:0 "Beneath the Great Candle"
 tradition_agot_candling_desc:0 "All hail the Great Candle. All shall worship the Great Candle. The Great Candle is wise. The Great Candle is our master; it will choose who will go and who will stay. CAN-DLE, CAN-DLE, CAN-DLE..."

Qarlon's great keep went up in flames, as did the towns and fishing villages along his shores.

It is said that not a man, woman, or child survived the Scouring of Lorath, so hot did those fires burn.”#!"

In time, however, the numbers of newcomers swelled whilst the ranks of the faithful dwindled. The worship of Boash fell away, as the priests who remained became more worldly and corrupt, forsaking their hair shirts, hoods, and piety and growing fat and rich off the taxes they extracted from those they ruled. Finally the fishermen, farmers, and other smallfolk rose in rebellion, throwing off the shackles of Boash.”#!"

Sarnori traders traveled to Valyria and Yi Ti, to Leng and Asshai. Sarnori ships sailed the Shivering Sea to Ib and the Thousand Islands and Far Mossovy.
