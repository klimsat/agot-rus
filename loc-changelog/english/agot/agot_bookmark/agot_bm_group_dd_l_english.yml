 agot_bm_8277_desc:0 "The once-promising rule of King Aerys II Targaryen has come to a perilous position: For many years, rumors and intrigues have surrounded the King and his Hand, a rift grown wide between the two former friends. Now, Lord Denys Darklyn has used that schism to his advantage, luring the King to treat at Duskendale — only to be taken hostage.\n\nThe power games between Lord Tywin Lannister and the King have allowed the Darklyns to achieve leverage over the Iron Throne unlike any House before them... #bold Yet, lofty ambitions oft lead to rash decisions, and the fate of the storied House Darklyn hangs in the balance.#!"

Heralded as one the greatest men to hold the position, many whisper that he truly sits the throne, saving the realm from the increasingly erratic fancies of the King. Their relationship strained, Tywin now spends more and more time trying to appease his once close friend from a growing paranoia.\n\n#bold Aerys has ignored his Hand’s counsel and ridden to deal with House Darklyn himself, and yet again Tywin must clean up after the King.#!"

But Denys Darklyn is a man driven to the extreme — some say to help the people of his city, some say by the counsel of his Myrish wife. Either way, he now faces an army outside his gates led by the dreaded Hand of the King, a King whom he holds hostage.\n\n#bold Will House Darklyn’s fame turn to infamy in an instant, or will Lord Denys succeed in leveraging the King’s safety for the greater prosperity of his people?#!"
