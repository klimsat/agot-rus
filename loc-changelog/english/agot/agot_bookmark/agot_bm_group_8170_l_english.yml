 agot_bm_8170_desc:0 "The Braavosi-Pentoshi wars rage across the Narrow Sea, a brutal struggle for dominance that threatens to consume the Free Cities. In Braavos, Tenesio Velaron, the newly elected Sealord, drives the city’s fleet to crush Pentos. Yet his rule is challenged by Donalo Prestayn, the deposed Sealord, who plots to reclaim his title and plunge Braavos into civil war. To the south, Prince Syssilio Estatis rallies his people to resist the Braavosi onslaught; though outmatched at sea, the wealth and cunning of Pentos make it a formidable foe. The Pentoshi have turned the city’s famed merchant fleets into instruments of war, while unrest simmers among Pentos’s enslaved masses.\n\nTo the west, Baelor ‘the Blessed’ rules the Seven Kingdoms with a hand as pious as it is impractical. The king dedicates his reign to building grand septs and secluding his sisters in the Maidenvault, fearing their beauty might tempt men to sin. Yet his neglect of governance leaves the realm adrift, and whispers of discontent grow among the lords.\n\n#bold While the Narrow Sea burns, Westeros sleeps — but even the holiest dreams must end.#!"

Outmatched at sea, the merchant port must quell unrest amongst its enslaved masses if it hopes to stand a chance in the wars to come.

 bookmark_170_donalo_prestayn_desc:0 "Once the Sealord of Braavos, the loquacious Donalo Prestayn was a master of politics and trade, whose feats abroad once brought wealth and power to the city. But his reign ended in betrayal, as rivals conspired to unseat him and install Tenesio Velaron in his place. Now, Donalo lurks in the shadows, weaving a web of disgruntled allies and plotting to reclaim the title he believes is rightfully his.\n\n#bold The Braavosi-Pentoshi war presents an opportunity to strike, but his ambitions threaten to plunge the city into chaos — or worse, lead to its destruction.#!"

A decade into his rule, Baelor’s fervor has only deepened. He has ordered a Great Sept be built in King’s Landing, burned books he deems heretical, and even released criminals who swore oaths of repentance. Yet his most controversial act remains the seclusion of his sisters in the Maidenvault, fearing their beauty might tempt men to sin.\n\n#bold The king’s devotion has won him the love of the smallfolk, but his court grows restless — some even question whether his piety has crossed into madness.#!"
