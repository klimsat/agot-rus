 agot_btw_interaction_events.0001.desc:0 "For too long, the black crows have picked apart the lands of the free folk like carrion — feasting on the death of our men, women, and children.\n\nBefore the kneelers came with their crowns and steel swords, all men shared this land. #bold And so it shall be again.#!\n\nJoin me, and we will bring a united fight against the kneelers!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0001.a:0 "Of course, I will join!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0001.b:0 "I will join... #italic for a price.#!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0001.c:0 "Ha! I would never join the likes of you, [wildling_caller.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]!"

 agot_btw_interaction_events.0002.opening:0 "To Arms!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0002.desc:0 "Once, long before the black crows descended upon us, the free folk lived in unity with the land. #bold Together, we may see that day again!#!\n\nThe kneelers will tremble in their steel armor when they catch sight of us — free folk, united in our fight against them!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0002.a:0 "Truly a sight to behold!"

 # FireFighter451 TODO It may be useful to add tooltips to these options.
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0003.opening:0 "For a Price..."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0003.desc:0 "I have no love in my heart for the kneelers, nor the black crows that protect the Wall.\n\nBut I do have love in my heart for gold, so I'll consider joining your cause if you'll meet my demands."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0003.a:0 "I need all the help I can afford."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0003.b:0 "My kin is worth more than gold."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0003.c:0 "You'll regret the day you made a beggar of me..."

 agot_btw_interaction_events.0004.opening:0 "On Your Own"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0004.desc:0 "I cannot imagine a worse way to die than joining your shit war against the kneelers.\n\nCome to think of it, who is worse? The bloody crows, or you, [ROOT.Char.GetCulture.GetName]." #AGOT TODO Add CulturalCurse if scripted.
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0004.a:0 "That vile fiend!"

 agot_btw_interaction_events.0005.opening:0 "Worth More Than Gold"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0005.desc:0 "I cannot meet your demands with gold, but I can give you something worth far more...\n\n[wildling_potential_house_hostage.GetFullName] is kin, of my own blood, and will serve as a worthy hostage during our war to come."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0005.a:0 "I cannot refuse such an offer."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0005.b:0 "Ha! A good jest."

 agot_btw_interaction_events.0006.opening:0 "To Arms!"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0006.desc:0 "You've proven yourself to be more than just talk — and that means an awful lot to us free folk.\n\nI'll join this war of yours. The kneelers will tremble at the sight of us."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0006.a:0 "Good to hear."

 agot_btw_interaction_events.0007.opening:0 "Enjoy Dying While I Feast"
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0007.desc:0 "To the foolish [ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip], your attempts to buy my allegiance have left me in good humors. #bold To think I'd even join the likes of you in battle!#!\n\nI cannot stop laughing..."
 agot_btw_interaction_events.0007.a:0 "Damn the scurrilous fiend!"
