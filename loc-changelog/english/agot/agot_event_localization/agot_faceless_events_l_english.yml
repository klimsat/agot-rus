 agot_faceless_interaction.0004.desc:0 "The salty breeze! The cawing of gulls! The bustle of dockworkers! It's a fine day to take it all in.\n\nFor a trip like this, I keep my entourage small. No need to cause a scene as an interested [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] wandering about the docks, inspecting the wares of various tradesfolk. I'm eyeing a particularly marvelous trinket when I hear a most wonderful melody: "Oysters, clams, and cockles," rings out like a song, and I can't help but to rush to the fishmonger's stand.\n\nI buy a dozen, tapping earnestly to ensure the worker provides me the best ones. And yet, as I am dining on my fifth, my head begins to swim."
 agot_faceless_interaction.0004.desc_faceless:0 "Suddenly, I am losing control of my bowels, and I fall upon a brass merchant's stall on my way the ground. I retch, expelling vile fluid from my mouth and nose.

 agot_faceless_interaction.0005.desc:0 "It oft amuses me how like my townsfolk are to a colony of bees, bumbling about in their business, traveling to and fro with urgency that must seem so significant to their slight status. Even today, the streets are bustling with workers; brewers and bakers, beggars and butchers.\n\nEven the town itself seems alive; new buildings being built, furnishings in transit to their new homes. Just ahead of my entourage, I see a large harp being hoisted by pulley to the third story of a house — surely that of some wealthy merchant. The street itself is nearly blocked by the workers, but no one would dare stop a ruler from passing by.\n\n"
 agot_faceless_interaction.0005.desc_faceless:0 "I step briskly below the taut ropes lifting the instrument when I hear a sudden snap, followed by shouts and a scream in quick succession.

 agot_faceless_interaction.0006.desc:0 "An escape from my duties, however brief, has done wonders for my stress. Out here on horseback one can feel a sense of purpose and pride that is often lost in the humdrum of ruling. My small entourage and I have opted to take a short break from the saddle to let our horses rest.\n\n"Quite the remarkable destrier," a servant remarks, taking a horse by the lead. I'm quite familiar with most in my entourage, yet something indiscernible seems amiss. I take a second glance at the servant, while the warhorse sips some water.\n\n"
 agot_faceless_interaction.0006.desc_faceless:0 "My focus on the servant's face proves all-consuming... I take a step closer, ready to grab hold of this possible intruder, when the horse before me makes a sudden jerking motion, kicking its leg with full force toward my face.

 agot_faceless_interaction.0006.desc_fakeout:0 "Aha, it's [servant.GetFirstName], I realize on closer inspection!

 agot_faceless_interaction.0007.desc:0 "Time alone is hard to come by for a ruler, which is why I relish even the briefest moment after my councilors' departure to myself. Today, after much tedious discussion, I find myself basking in solitude in the council chamber — allowing my mind to wander where it will.\n\nAs I sit, enraptured in idle thought, I notice a glint from atop a nearby bookshelf. I take a second glance, and this time I can see clearly there is something gilded atop the bookshelf; some rare treasure, tucked away from sight and out of mind.\n\nI pick up my chair and move it to the edge of the bookshelf, hopping up and reaching for the top... but alas, whatever it is remains just out of reach. If only I could stretch #italic slightly#! further...\n\n"
 agot_faceless_interaction.0007.desc_faceless:0 "As my fingertips graze the top of the bookshelf, I hear a shuffling behind me, but before I can react the chair is pulled from beneath me and the world is toppling... I hear a gruesome crack, a faint cry that sounds much like my own voice, then it all goes black."
 agot_faceless_interaction.0007.desc_fakeout:0 "The chair wobbles slightly beneath me, but I steady myself against the shelves. I look around, struck by a sudden discomfort, as though someone is watching me... I hop down, resigning myself to a missed opportunity."

I take every caution to ensure that I am alone with my thoughts for these walks, leaving behind even my personal guards while I take in the view from up high.\n\nFrom atop the wallwalk, my duties shrink away — and I feel just a bit lighter. As I lean myself between two merlons, I can feel the wind rushing up the castle wall to meet me... It feels almost like flying.\n\n"
 agot_faceless_interaction.0008.desc_faceless:0 "For a moment, I'm lost in the feeling; the rush of air against my face, flooding my senses. I can almost swear I hear movement behind me, when suddenly my body feels weightless. I no longer feel almost like flying... I #bold am#! flying — or rather falling toward the rough-hewn courtyard below. I gasp, but the air gives me no respite from my demise."
 agot_faceless_interaction.0008.desc_fakeout:0 "Though I'm momentarily lost in the feeling, my eyes begin to tear up at the rush of air, and I pull myself back. As I take a step back, an eerie feeling floods my senses... As though someone was watching me."

To think, such livelihood is owed to my own good stewardship.\n\nBut among the tradesfolk are those less fortunate souls; those wretches who survive merely off scraps and the small kindnesses of others. This afternoon, I come across one such soul, who would otherwise be easy to ignore, if not for his large #bold mastiff#!.\n\nSuch a rare breed — and, judging by its looks, well-fed! In fact, though its owner is all skin and bones, the dog looks to be all muscle. I approach the pauper, figuring I may offer a bit of coin and take his pup to a better life in my kennels.\n\n"
