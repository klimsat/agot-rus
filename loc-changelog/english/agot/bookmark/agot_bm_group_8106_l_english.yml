 agot_bm_8106_desc:0 "In the early part of King Viserys I Targaryen’s reign, his chief annoyance was his own brother: Prince Daemon Targaryen. Daemon was mercurial and quick to take offense, but he was also daring, dashing, and dangerous. He was one of his brother’s brashest supporters in the Great Council — though some say he was motivated by the belief he would be named heir. However, Daemon’s niece Rhaenyra was named heir instead, and now the king has remarried to the young Alicent Hightower.\n\nSeemingly grown tired of waiting for a crown, Daemon is now determined to carve out a kingdom of his own. In this, he and Lord Corlys Velaryon have made common cause, thanks to the predation of the Triarchy of the Three Daughters. This fledgling alliance of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh is menacing the trade flowing through the Stepstones, and #bold the Rogue Prince has pledged to stop them#!."

Believing he would be heir, he was a brash supporter of his brother, King Viserys I, in the Great Council — even raising an army in his brother’s name. However, with Rhaenyra named heir and Viserys married once more, Daemon sees his chance at the throne crumbling. He is now determined to carve out his own kingdom, and astride the dragon Caraxes, he flies alongside the Velaryon fleet to destroy the Triarchy’s hold on the Stepstones.\n\n#bold Will this rogue prince have his kingdom, or will the fire and death he brings come to him instead?#!"

His refusal to name Daemon as his heir has led his brother to ally himself with Lord Corlys Velaryon to carve out his own kingdom in the Stepstones. Though breaking the Triarchy’s hold on those trade routes would be a boon to Westeros, Viserys must balance his love for his brother — and his desire to see him succeed — with the threat that another Targaryen ruler would pose.\n\n#bold Will Viserys thread the needle of his brother’s ambition and the stranglehold of the Three Daughters?#!"

Craghas found success with his brutal method of feeding the pirate lords to the crabs of the island, and now grows wealthy off the steep tolls levied on passing ships. However, a new challenger sails — and flies — from the north that seeks to upset this balance. The Crabfeeder faces the greatest foe of his career, and the fate of the Triarchy may rest on his shoulders.\n\n#bold How will the Crabfeeder defeat the greatest fleet of the Narrow Sea, along with an ambition not seen since Aegon ‘the Conqueror’ rewrote the world?#!"
