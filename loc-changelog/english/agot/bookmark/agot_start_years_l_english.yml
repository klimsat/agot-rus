 ### 82 A.C. / Reign of the Conciliator ###
 start_year_8082_01_01_desc:0 "It has been thirty-four years since Maegor ‘the Cruel’ met his end — and Westeros has never before known such a golden age. A generation of peace and prosperity, all of it overseen by the Conciliator and the Good Queen. With a score of heirs, the succession is secure, and threats to the reign of House Targaryen have been brought into the fold by the deft diplomacy of the king.\n\nBut peace cannot last forever. Tensions rise in Dorne, as the heir to the Principality wishes for a war of vengeance against the Iron Throne, and within the House of the Dragon younger heirs oft feel neglected and defy the will of their sire.\n\n#bold Whispers spread among the smallfolk, many of whom already say that the golden age may soon fade — or has already tarnished.#!"

 ### 106 A.C. / The Rogue Prince ###
 start_year_8106_04_18_desc:0 "In the early part of King Viserys I Targaryen’s reign, his chief annoyance was his own brother: Prince Daemon Targaryen. Daemon was mercurial and quick to take offense, but he was also daring, dashing, and dangerous. He was one of his brother’s brashest supporters in the Great Council — though some say he was motivated by the belief he would be named heir. However, Daemon’s niece Rhaenyra was named heir instead, and now the king has remarried to the young Alicent Hightower.\n\nSeemingly grown tired of waiting for a crown, Daemon is now determined to carve out a kingdom of his own. In this, he and Lord Corlys Velaryon have made common cause, thanks to the predation of the Triarchy of the Three Daughters. This fledgling alliance of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh is menacing the trade flowing through the Stepstones, and #bold the Rogue Prince has pledged to stop them#!."

 ### 170 A.C. / The Titan Marches ###
 start_year_8170_12_11_desc:0 "The Braavosi-Pentoshi wars rage across the Narrow Sea, a brutal struggle for dominance that threatens to consume the Free Cities. In Braavos, Tenesio Velaron, the newly elected Sealord, drives the city’s fleet to crush Pentos. Yet his rule is challenged by Donalo Prestayn, the deposed Sealord, who plots to reclaim his title and plunge Braavos into civil war. To the south, Prince Syssilio Estatis rallies his people to resist the Braavosi onslaught; though outmatched at sea, the wealth and cunning of Pentos make it a formidable foe. The Pentoshi have turned the city’s famed merchant fleets into instruments of war, while unrest simmers among Pentos’s enslaved masses.\n\nTo the west, Baelor ‘the Blessed’ rules the Seven Kingdoms with a hand as pious as it is impractical. The king dedicates his reign to building grand septs and secluding his sisters in the Maidenvault, fearing their beauty might tempt men to sin. Yet his neglect of governance leaves the realm adrift, and whispers of discontent grow among the lords.\n\n#bold While the Narrow Sea burns, Westeros sleeps — but even the holiest dreams must end.#!"

 ### 209 A.C. / The Shadows of Ashford ###
 start_year_8209_02_01_desc:0 "Shadows gather in the aftermath of the Tournament at the Ashford Meadow. Baelor Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, lies dead — tragically slain by his younger brother Maekar in the defense of a lowly hedge knight. The steady hand of Baelor Breakspear will now never grace the Iron Throne; in his stead stands his son, the untested Prince Valarr. He had come to Ashford seeking small glory, but leaves a changed man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAs a cloud of uncertainty grows over King’s Landing, those seeking to threaten the Iron Throne grow emboldened. In the free city of Tyrosh, the children of the Black Dragon have come into their maturity under the watchful eye of their uncle, Bittersteel. Likewise, the Lord Reaper of Pyke relishes the weakening of House Targaryen once more. #bold Enemies can be seen in every shadow, waiting for the perfect moment to raise their banner to challenge the Good King yet again.#!"

 ### 233 A.C. / The Peake Uprising ###
 start_year_8233_02_08_desc: "After a hundred years of decline and three failed attempts to sit a Blackfyre pretender on the Iron Throne, House Peake has risen once more in rebellion against the line of Daeron ‘the Good.’\n\nDespite his age, King Maekar I Targaryen remains a mighty warrior and personally leads a host of Crownlanders and Westermen to crush the petty, doomed uprising. After every other challenge Maekar has faced in his near sixty years, surely #italic this#! will be the easiest.\n\n#bold Shall the Peakes succeed against all odds, or will the once-proud dynasty slide further into obscurity?#!"

 ### 239 A.C. / The Laughing Storm ###
 start_year_8239_01_11_desc:0 "Lord Lyonel Baratheon of the Stormlands, a man both feared and respected, earned the name ‘the Laughing Storm’ for his fierce yet unpredictable nature. A towering figure in the Seven Kingdoms, his daughter’s betrothal to Prince Duncan Targaryen was meant to unite two great houses. Yet, in an act that sent a thunderclap through the realm, Prince Duncan forsook this alliance for the love of a lowborn girl, Jenny of Oldstones.\n\nTo the Baratheons, this was not merely a broken betrothal — but a grievous insult that stained the honor of their House. Now, the Laughing Storm rages. The bonds that once held the realm together are fraying, and the winds of rebellion stir in the Stormlands. With pride wounded and fury in his heart, Lord Lyonel must decide if he will bend or shatter the peace of the realm, casting his lot against the Iron Throne itself.\n\nA question hangs over the realm like a pall: #bold How far will the Laughing Storm go to restore the honor of his House?#!"

 ### 258 A.C. / The Ninepenny Kings ###
 start_year_8258_12_21_desc:0 "A Blackfyre pretender rises once more in the east, as a terrifying new captain-general has taken command of the Golden Company with his sights set on the Iron Throne.\n\nMaelys the Monstrous lives up to his name, and a growing alliance of pirates, outlaws, and exiles have pledged support to the would-be king. The self-fashioned Band of Nine may yet make trouble for the lords and ladies of Westeros.\n\nBut King Aegon V Targaryen has concerns at home to match the threat abroad. A champion of the smallfolk, his many reforms have upset rulers across the Seven Kingdoms, and betrothals spurned by his children have soured what little support he once held. And turmoil in the west has turned feverish, the risk of rebellion from the cunning Lord Roger Reyne held in fraught precarity.\n\n#bold Hope for the king rests in the ancient texts of Asshai, promising a rebirth of dragons to usher in a new era of prosperity. But as the inferno around him grows, it risks swallowing him whole.#!"

 ### 277 A.C. / Defiance of Duskendale ###
 start_year_8277_01_01_desc:0 "The once-promising rule of King Aerys II Targaryen has come to a perilous position: For many years, rumors and intrigues have surrounded the King and his Hand, a rift grown wide between the two former friends. Now, Lord Denys Darklyn has used that schism to his advantage, luring the King to treat at Duskendale — only to be taken hostage.\n\nThe power games between Lord Tywin Lannister and the King have allowed the Darklyns to achieve leverage over the Iron Throne unlike any House before them... #bold Yet, lofty ambitions oft lead to rash decisions, and the fate of the storied House Darklyn hangs in the balance.#!"

 ### 282 A.C. / Robert's Rebellion ###
 start_year_8282_09_15_desc:0 "The Year of the False Spring has passed, and #italic winter is coming#! — and along with it, a spark that will ignite the Seven Kingdoms.\n\nRhaegar Targaryen, heir to the Iron Throne, has kidnapped Lyanna Stark, daughter of the Warden of the North and betrothed to the Lord Paramount of the Stormlands. When her brother Brandon Stark rode south demanding redress for her abduction, the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen denied him a fair hearing, brutally executing him alongside his father.\n\nBut when the Mad King called for the heads of the young Lords Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale instead raised his banners in rebellion. #bold As fighting spreads across Westeros like wildfire, it is up to you to decide the fate of the kingdom. For when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.#!"

 ### 284 A.C. / The Crowned Stag ###
 start_year_8284_06_02_desc:0 "The War of the Usurper, Robert’s Rebellion — it matters not what smallfolk call it, but that #italic it is done.#!\n\nThe Targaryens are all but wiped out, their last scions scattered to the Free Cities in the form of a young man and a babe in arms. Robert I Baratheon now sits upon the Iron Throne of Westeros, but he soon realizes that being a king is not so easy as he had expected.\n\n“Honor? I’ve got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it’s honor that’s keeping the peace? #bold It’s fear! Fear and blood!#!”"
