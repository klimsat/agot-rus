 agot_bm_8259_desc:0 "A Blackfyre pretender rises once more in the east, as a terrifying new captain-general has taken command of the Golden Company with his sights set on the Iron Throne.\n\nMaelys ‘the Monstrous’ lives up to his name, and a growing alliance of pirates, outlaws, and exiles have pledged support to the would-be king. The self-fashioned Band of Nine may yet make trouble for the lords and ladies of Westeros.\n\nBut King Aegon V Targaryen has concerns at home to match the threat abroad. A champion of the smallfolk, his many reforms have upset rulers across the Seven Kingdoms, and betrothals spurned by his children have soured what little support he once held. And turmoil in the west has turned feverish, the risk of rebellion from the cunning Lord Roger Reyne held in fraught precarity.\n\n#bold Hope for the king rests in the ancient texts of Asshai, promising a rebirth of dragons to usher in a new era of prosperity. But as the inferno around him grows, it risks swallowing him whole.#!"

To gain control of the Golden Company, he killed a war horse with a single punch and pulled his cousin Daemon’s head from his body. Now, surrounded by nefarious supporters, he may just have the strength to fulfill the destiny of the Black Dragon.\n\n#bold Brute strength may win battles, but will Maelys have the cunning and tact to take the Seven Kingdoms for his own?#!"
