 agot_bm_8082_desc:0 "It has been thirty-four years since Maegor ‘the Cruel’ met his end — and Westeros has never before known such a golden age. A generation of peace and prosperity, all of it overseen by the Conciliator and the Good Queen. With a score of heirs, the succession is secure, and threats to the reign of House Targaryen have been brought into the fold by the deft diplomacy of the king.\n\nBut peace cannot last forever. Tensions rise in Dorne, as the heir to the Principality wishes for a war of vengeance against the Iron Throne, and within the House of the Dragon younger heirs oft feel neglected and defy the will of their sire.\n\n#bold Whispers spread among the smallfolk, many of whom say that the golden age may soon fade — or has already tarnished.#!"

 bookmark_82_jaehaerys_targaryen_desc:0 "When the Conciliator was born, few thought he would ever sit the throne, and not even Jaehaerys himself could have dreamt he’d be hailed as a greater king than the Conqueror. Though the realm united after his tyrannical uncle’s demise, family troubles now dominate the life of the king in a very different way. Alongside the Good Queen, must now look to keeping his family together.\n\n#bold For a third of a century, Jaehaerys has kept peace — but under the pressures of his lords, foreign princes, and his own children, will he be able to keep it for much longer?#!"

 bookmark_82_aemon_targaryen_desc:0 "The second-born and eldest surviving son of the Conciliator and the Good Queen, the pale-haired Aemon has had an easy life by the standards of Targaryen princes who came before him. Without war or rebellion, his ascension to the throne seems certain. His own succession is less clear: With only a daughter — who takes after her Baratheon mother — the Prince of Dragonstone will have to pray to the Seven for the son that has eluded him, or remake the order of things to see his daughter succeed.\n\n#bold Can Aemon secure the succession and honor his father’s legacy, securing peace for another generation?#!"

 bookmark_82_mors_martell_desc:0 "Since Rhaenys and Meraxes were felled in the Conqueror’s attempt to break the Dornish, a sense of pride and anxiety has overwhelmed the Martells of Dorne. Pride for being the only rulers to halt the Dragon’s advance; anxiety for knowing that one day dark wings may swallow whole towns in their shadow once again. The prince’s heir, Morion, is stoking the flames, and some fear that when the son comes to rule, he will drive the Dragons to war against Dorne once more.\n\n#bold Can Prince Mors Martell secure a free future for Dorne — to remain unbowed, unbent, and unbroken?#!"

 bookmark_82_manfryd_redwyne_desc:0 "A status of unique prestige, Lord Manfryd serves as the first master of ships not of House Velaryon. With one son who has sworn his sword to the Kingsguard and another who leads the City Watch of King’s Landing, House Redwyne has not known such heights since before the Dragons came. But the lord admiral fears it will be just a passing moment, with the Sea Snake and his legendary voyages across the known world — it stands near impossible that Ser Robert will succeed him in the council seat.\n\n#bold Can Manfryd solidify his relationship with the crown, or will it be snuffed out as soon as he or the Wise King pass on?#!"

 bookmark_82_lyman_beesbury_desc:0 "Never a House of great prominence, the financial talents of Lord Lyman have brought him to the attention of King Jaehaerys, and many wonder aloud if one day Lyman will sit upon the small council. But scandal threatens Lyman’s future — and that of his House. His son and heir, Ser Braxton, who has found himself far too familiar with Princess Saera and her courtiers. The Lord of Honeyholt fears such bumbling may doom his son to death or exile, a fate of his own making.\n\n#bold Can Lyman bring his son back in line, bringing more glory and power to his House in the process? Or will he forever toil in the shadow of the Hightower?#!"

 bookmark_82_roy_connington_desc:0 "Charming, brave, and already a lord in his own right, ‘Red’ Roy is everything that young highborn maidens wish for in their lord-husband. Though he is not a perfect knight, he and his friends — Jonah Mooton and Ser Braxton Beesbury — have found themselves consumed by the lust of youth, bedding Perianne Moore, Alys Turnburry, and most dangerously of all, Princess Saera Targaryen. Should the Wise King discover ‘Red’ Roy and his friends’ misdeeds, it may mean death or the Wall.\n\n#bold Can ‘Red’ Roy avoid the watchful eyes of the crown and prove a worthy ruler? Or will he forever remain a misguided child?#!"

The future of the dynasty currently resides at the Citadel, earning links in his chain to one day return home as a wise and just ruler. Lyonel is not without his impulses however: A babe recently arrived at the gates of her grandsire’s keep. Alys, the baseborn daughter of the maester-playing heir, whose mother’s identity was lost on the journey back from the Citadel, brings a stain to Osmund’s legacy.\n\n#bold Can Osmund and his ilk survive and prosper in Harrenhal, or will they be claimed as yet another victim of Black Harren’s curse?#!"
