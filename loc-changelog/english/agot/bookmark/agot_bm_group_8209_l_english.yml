 agot_bm_8209_desc:0 "Shadows gather in the aftermath of the Tournament at the Ashford Meadow. Baelor Targaryen, Prince of Dragonstone, Hand of the King, and Protector of the Realm, lies dead — tragically slain by his younger brother Maekar in the defense of a lowly hedge knight. The steady hand of Baelor Breakspear will now never grace the Iron Throne; in his stead stands his son, the untested Prince Valarr. He had come to Ashford seeking small glory, but leaves a changed man with the weight of the world on his shoulders.\n\nAs a cloud of uncertainty grows over King’s Landing, those seeking to threaten the Iron Throne grow emboldened. In the free city of Tyrosh, the children of the Black Dragon have come into their maturity under the watchful eye of their uncle, Bittersteel. Likewise, the Lord Reaper of Pyke relishes the weakening of House Targaryen once more. #bold Enemies can be seen in every shadow, waiting for the perfect moment to raise their banner to challenge the Good King yet again.#!"

His son and heir, Baelor Targaryen, has tragically perished in the defense of a hedge knight during the Ashford Tourney. Accidentally slain by Daeron’s youngest son Maekar, Baelor’s death has weakened the House of the dragon once more. With Baelor’s son Valarr confirmed as the new Prince of Dragonstone and Hand of the King, Daeron must ensure that Breakspear’s death does not upset the fragile peace Westeros has known for the past thirteen years.\n\n#bold Can Daeron the Good once again guide Westeros to a period of prosperity, or will the ghosts of his brother and son doom him?#!"

 bookmark_209_dagon_greyjoy_desc:0 "Dagon Greyjoy, Lord of the Iron Islands, honors the Old Way. To say otherwise is to challenge the very might of the Lord Reaper of Pyke. He has watched as the House of the dragon has withered and led the green lands into decay, and is no longer content to be contained under the yoke of Targaryen weakness.\n\n#bold With Westeros looking east, will Dagon succeed in truly honoring the ways of his ancestors?#!"

Now, his namesake and eldest surviving son, Daemon II, has come into his own while exiled in Tyrosh. Bittersteel lurks like a menacing shadow over Daemon, urging him that now is not the right time to invade Westeros. But Aegor has left to serve as a sellsword, and Daemon broods in Tyrosh with only his brothers and sisters as company. With the death of his cousin Baelor, Daemon sees potential where his uncle does not.\n\n#bold Can Daemon the Younger rid Westeros of the Targaryen usurpers and claim his father’s rightful throne?#!"

Glory that most men only achieve in their dreams, but words Valarr Targaryen had not hoped to hear for another generation. With the death of his father, Baelor Breakspear, the young prince now inherits his father’s esteemed position — next in line to the throne, and Hand of the King to his grandsire, King Daeron II. Valarr has sworn on his father’s memory to be good and just, and to rule as he would have, but Westeros approaches a time of uncertainty not seen since the Blackfyre Rebellion.\n\n#bold Can Prince Valarr uphold his father’s legacy to maintain the security and stability of House Targaryen?#!"

Baelor Breakspear was beloved across the land, but his younger brother lacks even half his charisma. Lords and common folk alike whisper accusations of fratricide as the realm grieves for its lost prince, but none will know the anguish Prince Maekar will face for the rest of his days.\n\n#bold Will the memory of Baelor Breakspear forever haunt Maekar?#!"
