 agot_bm_8211_desc:0 "For nearly two years the Great Spring Sickness ravaged Westeros, leaving the corpses of tens of thousands in its wake. Among the slain were King Daeron ‘the Good’ and his grandson and heir Prince Valarr. With their deaths came the crowning of a new king, Daeron’s second son Aerys, the first of his name. Aerys chose his bastard-born uncle Brynden ‘Bloodraven’ for a Hand, enraging his youngest brother Maekar — known unaffectionately as kinslayer following the disastrous Tourney at Ashford Meadow.\n\nThe Prince of Summerhall has returned to his lands to sulk. As he does, his own fourth son, Prince Aegon, travels with a hedge knight known as Ser Duncan ‘the Tall.’ #bold Though merely a baseborn son of Flea Bottom, Egg’s mentor may soon find himself at the center of grand songs of lords, ladies, princes, and kings once more.#!"

He and his eldest sons died upon the Redgrass Field, leaving his younger son Daemon as heir to his contested claim. With the death of the king and the coronation of the bookish Aerys I, there may be no greater opportunity for Daemon ‘the Younger’ to make a play for the Iron Throne. In his way stands ‘Bittersteel,’ his uncle thus far having denied him both his father’s sword and crown.\n\n#bold Will he do what his father could not and seize the Iron Throne?#!"

In that time Duncan has continued his journeys with his squire — the secret Prince Aegon Targaryen, son of Prince Maekar. As the Spring Sickness raged across Westeros, Dunk and Egg found refuge in the sands of Dorne. Now he serves the aging Ser Eustace Osgrey as a sworn sword, taking up residence at the tower of Standfast.\n\n#bold Will Dunk stay true to his oath, or shall he find a greater master?#!"

His once-proud House has been reduced to only the tower of Standfast, and he to a grieving man beyond the prime of his life, waiting for death. There are those around him who see weakness, who see a chance to take what little the old knight has left. To his service he has taken Ser Bennis of the Brown Shield, and Ser Duncan ‘the Tall.’\n\n#bold Can this old Chequy Lion keep his pride and his tower, or will he crumble with the last of his House’s glory?#!"
