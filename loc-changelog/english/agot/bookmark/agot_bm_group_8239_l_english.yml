 agot_bm_8239_desc:0 "Lord Lyonel Baratheon of the Stormlands, a man both feared and respected, earned the name ‘the Laughing Storm’ for his fierce yet unpredictable nature. A towering figure in the Seven Kingdoms, his daughter’s betrothal to Prince Duncan Targaryen was meant to unite two great Houses. Yet, in an act that sent a thunderclap through the realm, Prince Duncan forsook this alliance for the love of a lowborn girl, Jenny of Oldstones.\n\nTo the Baratheons, this was not merely a broken betrothal — but a grievous insult that stained the honor of their House. Now, the Laughing Storm rages. The bonds that once held the realm together are fraying, and the winds of rebellion stir in the Stormlands. With pride wounded and fury in his heart, Lord Lyonel must decide if he will bend or shatter the peace of the realm, casting his lot against the Iron Throne itself.\n\nA question hangs over the realm like a pall: #bold How far will the Laughing Storm go to restore the honor of his House?#!"

Once the most steadfast of the great houses, House Baratheon has severed its ties with the Iron Throne, driven by the grievous dishonor inflicted upon Lyonel’s daughter by Duncan, the Prince of Dragonstone. The so-called heir abandoned her for another, and a lowborn woman at that.\n\n#bold Shall Lyonel have his revenge, no matter the cost?#!"

Yet, through the reckless actions of his children, the realm teeters on the brink of fracturing.
