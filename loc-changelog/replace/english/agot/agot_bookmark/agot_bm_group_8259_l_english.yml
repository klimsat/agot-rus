 agot_bm_8259_desc:0 "A Blackfyre pretender rises once more in the east, as a terrifying new captain-general has taken command of the Golden Company with his sights set on the Iron Throne.\n\nMaelys the Monstrous lives up to his name, and a growing alliance of pirates, outlaws, and exiles have pledged support to the would-be king. The self-fashioned Band of Nine may yet make trouble for the lords and ladies of Westeros.\n\nBut King Aegon V Targaryen has concerns at home to match the threat abroad. A champion of the smallfolk, his many reforms have upset rulers across the Seven Kingdoms, and betrothals spurned by his children have soured what little support he once held. And turmoil in the west has turned feverish, the risk of rebellion from the cunning Lord Roger Reyne held in fraught precarity.\n\n#bold Hope for the king rests in the ancient texts of Asshai, promising a rebirth of dragons to usher in a new era of prosperity. But as the inferno around him grows, it risks swallowing him whole.#!"

To gain control of the Golden Company, he killed a war horse with a single punch and pulled his cousin Daemon’s head from his body. Now, surrounded by nefarious supporters, he may just have the strength to fulfill the destiny of the Black Dragon.\n\n#bold Brute strength may win battles, but will Maelys have the cunning and tact to take the Seven Kingdoms for his own?#!"

Yet fate is a fickle mistress, and the affable Egg has ruled the Seven Kingdoms deftly for twenty-five years — improving the lives of smallfolk, navigating broken betrothals, and putting end to uprisings small and mighty.\n\n#bold At the brink of yet another rebellion, as a Blackfyre host musters under the formidable Maelys the Monstrous, Aegon is consumed by his dream of bringing back dragons, but will the dream be his undoing?#!"

Such was the case with his love for his sister, the Princess Shaera. When their older brother, Prince Duncan the Small, put aside his own inheritance to take a commoner as his bride, Jaehaerys took note — and secretly wed and consummated the traditional Targaryen marriage to Shaera.\n\n#bold As rebellion foments in the east, how will the young prince take hold of his destiny and guide the future of House Targaryen?#!"

Once known as the Laughing Lion for his jovial nature, Tytos lost much verve with the passing of his wife, Lady Jeyne Marbrand, and his unruly vassals have been quick to take advantage of their forgiving liege.\n\n#bold As a new lion bares his teeth from the seat of Castamere, will Tytos find the will — and a way — to restore order to the Westerlands? Or might his brood of willful cubs take matters into their own hands for the sake of House Lannister?#!"

But following Tion’s death during the Fourth Blackfyre Rebellion, he returned to the mines of Castamere to plot the future of his family.\n\n#bold The lion’s claws are sharp, but are they long enough to reach the near-impenetrable seat of House Lannister?#!"
