 bookmark_10_aegon_targaryen_desc:0 "Aegon ‘the Dragon’ has ruled his newly conquered kingdom for nearly ten years, with only Dorne left to challenge his supremacy over the continent south of the Wall. But war against the Dornish rebels lingers on the horizon, as Aegon’s beloved sister-wife and queen Rhaenys perished upon her dragon Meraxes in an attempt at bringing the unbowed to heel. The king’s remaining sister-wife Visenya grieves with him, devising ways to keep the House of the Dragon safe from would-be assassins lurking behind every door.\n\n#bold While Visenya considers personal safety, Aegon considers how best to defend their new capital against attack, with the pitiful defenses of the Aegonfort seeming entirely insufficient for the seat of a continent-spanning realm.#!"

 bookmark_129_aegon_targaryen_desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen, the Second of His Name, claimed the Iron Throne following the death of his father Viserys I. Though his half-sister Rhaenyra was the chosen heir of their father and the Princess of Dragonstone, Aegon took hold of King’s Landing and the realm all the same.\n\n#bold Though war may soon break out as a result of this usurpation, Aegon bears the sword, crown, and name of the Conqueror — and he expects the realm to cleave to him quickly. If Rhaenyra chooses not to bend the knee, she will know Fire and Blood!#!"

 bookmark_153_aegon_targaryen_desc:0 "For twenty-two years, Aegon ‘the Unlucky’ has reigned from atop the Iron Throne. He has no shortage of heirs, with two sons — Daeron and Baelor — being reared at court, and two nephews through his brother Viserys. Despite the certainty of his succession, the safety of his House is in constant question. \n\n#bold With the death of the dragons, the source of Targaryen power is waning; marriages must now be negotiated, and deals struck, if the House of the Dragon is to remain in its high seat of power.#!"

 bookmark_178_aegon_targaryen_desc:0 "Aegon Targaryen, the Fourth of His Name, has reigned for only six years, but in that time he has proven himself a decadent, degenerate, and corrupt ruler with little regard for affairs of state. Between strife with his eldest son — and sole trueborn heir — Daeron, mutual hatred with his well-loved brother Aemon ‘the Dragonknight,’ and fraught relationship with his sister-wife Naerys, Aegon has proven himself a weak-willed king ruled more by his own pleasures than any duty to the realm.\n\n#bold Though his bastards may well be countless, Aegon’s so-called “Great Bastards” may determine the fate of the realm as Aegon navigates the mess he has made of the House of the Dragon.#!"
