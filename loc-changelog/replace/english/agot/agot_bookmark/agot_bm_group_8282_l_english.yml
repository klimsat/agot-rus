When her brother Brandon Stark rode south demanding redress for her abduction, the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen denied him a fair hearing, brutally executing him alongside his father.\n\nBut when the Mad King called for the heads of the young Lords Eddard Stark and Robert Baratheon, Lord Jon Arryn of the Vale instead raised his banners in rebellion. #bold As fighting spreads across Westeros like wildfire, it is up to you to decide the fate of the kingdom. For when you play the Game of Thrones, you either win or you die.#!"

At the Tourney of Harrenhal, scandal shook the realm when Rhaegar crowned a daughter of the North his Queen of Love and Beauty, rather than his own wife.
