 agot_bm_8106_desc:0 "In the early part of King Viserys I Targaryen’s reign, his chief annoyance was his own brother: Prince Daemon Targaryen. Daemon was mercurial and quick to take offense, but he was also daring, dashing, and dangerous. He was one of his brother’s brashest supporters in the Great Council — though some say he was motivated by the belief he would be named heir. However, Daemon’s niece Rhaenyra was named heir instead, and now the king has remarried to the young Alicent Hightower.\n\nSeemingly grown tired of waiting for a crown, Daemon is now determined to carve out a kingdom of his own. In this, he and Lord Corlys Velaryon have made common cause, thanks to the predation of the Triarchy of the Three Daughters. This fledgling alliance of Lys, Myr, and Tyrosh is menacing the trade flowing through the Stepstones, and #bold the Rogue Prince has pledged to stop them#!."

Believing he would be heir, he was a brash supporter of his brother, King Viserys I, in the Great Council — even raising an army in his brother’s name. However, with Rhaenyra named heir and Viserys married once more, Daemon sees his chance at the throne crumbling. He is now determined to carve out his own kingdom, and astride the dragon Caraxes, he flies alongside the Velaryon fleet to destroy the Triarchy’s hold on the Stepstones.\n\n#bold Will this rogue prince have his kingdom, or will the fire and death he brings come to him instead?#!"

 bookmark_106_viserys_targaryen_desc:0 "The well-loved, if not well-respected, King Viserys I Targaryen has ruled the Seven Kingdoms for just over three years, and in that time there has been one constant thorn in his side: his brother, Prince Daemon. His refusal to name Daemon as his heir has led his brother to ally himself with Lord Corlys Velaryon to carve out his own kingdom in the Stepstones. Though breaking the Triarchy’s hold on those trade routes would be a boon to Westeros, Viserys must balance his love for his brother — and his desire to see him succeed — with the threat that another Targaryen ruler would pose.\n\n#bold Will Viserys thread the needle of his brother’s ambition and the stranglehold of the Three Daughters?#!"
