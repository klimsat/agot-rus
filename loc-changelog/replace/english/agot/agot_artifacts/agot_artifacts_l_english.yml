The shape clearly resembled that of the historical Crowns of Winter from House Stark, though it differed enough in its color, design and material to be noteworthy. The material of the spikes themselves is a matter for debate, as few who recorded its properties could confidently identify whether they were diamond, glass, or some other crystal. There are even those who believe they were made of true ice, maintained by ancient magics of the Children of the Forest. It is unknown who bore that crown or why it was made. Many believe it was made in homage to House Stark, perhaps worn by a Queen or Princess of Winterfell. Others, however, claim it was made in mockery of the dominion that the Stark Kings claimed over Winter. Even more ludicrous are the stories that persist of it having been the very crown made for the blue-eyed Corpse Queen, lover of the legendary Night's King of the Night's Watch.
