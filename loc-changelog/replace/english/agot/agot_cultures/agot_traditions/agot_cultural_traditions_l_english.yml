 # Traditions
 agot_tradition_andal_name:0 "Faith and Fury"
 agot_tradition_andal_desc:1 "The Andals hail from Northern Essos, though none know precisely where. With the continued expansion of the land-hungry Valyrian freehold, the Andals were forced to flee from their native homelands to Westeros, sweeping over everywhere south of the Neck and bringing their religious fervour and traditions of Knighthood and chivalry along with them."
 agot_tradition_crownlander_name:0 "Born of the Blackwater"
 agot_tradition_crownlander_desc:1 "The Crownlanders are a people whose culture has been shaped by their proximity to the centre of royal power and by the trade that flows into Blackwater Bay. The robust administration and relative prosperity of the Crownlands have shaped its people into merchants, artisans, and traders. They are a far less martial people than the Stormlanders to the south and far more prosperous than the Rivermen to the north."
 agot_tradition_fingerman_name:0 "Humble Service"
 agot_tradition_fingerman_desc:1 "The Fingers are a dreary, windswept place, so assailed by the winds from the frigid north that little vegetation grows near their tips. There is little living to be made for the smallfolk beyond herding grazing animals, for there’s scant land to make usable cropland of. Thus, the Fingermen live modest lives, and the goatherds and sharecroppers find some contentedness in their unforgiving home."
 agot_tradition_harborman_name:0 "From Mander to the Knife"
 agot_tradition_harborman_desc:1 "The Harbormen are a people settled around White Harbor, the largest settlement in the North. They carry with them the strongest Andal influence of any people in the North, House Manderly having brought the Faith of the Seven and many other Andal customs with them after their expulsion from the Reach. "
 agot_tradition_honeywiner_name:0 "Soft and Sweet"
 agot_tradition_honeywiner_desc:1 "The men of the Honeywine and its surrounding lands are some of the most prosperous in all Westeros. With fertile lands and the great city of Oldtown, much trade flows through the river that gives the people their name. With the Citadel and Starry sept, the area is a bastion of learning in Westeros, with even many smallfolk being lettered."
 agot_tradition_marcher_name:0 "Blood and Steel"
 agot_tradition_marcher_desc:1 "The men of the Dornish Marches are some of the fiercest warriors in Westeros and have produced many of its finest warriors. Their culture is built upon; its cornerstone lies, upon centuries, if not millennia, of back-and-forth border skirmishes with the Stony Dornishmen across the mountains. The men of the Marches have a long memory, and most of that is used to remember generational grudges."
 agot_tradition_moonman_name:0 "High Above"
 agot_tradition_moonman_desc:1 "Set apart from their kin who make their homes in the Vale’s fertile valleys, the men who dwell in the heights of the Mountains of the Moon are a far more rugged, stalwart folk. In times of war, it is they who man the first lines of defence against outside incursions, and with their lives at high-altitude, it is also they who must deal the most with incursions from the Mountain Clansmen."
 agot_tradition_reachman_name:0 "Greenhand's Glory"
 agot_tradition_reachman_desc:1 "The Reach is a prosperous and fertile land built on the backs of hardworking smallfolk. It is also a land of families with some of the oldest roots in Westeros, dating back to the mythical Garth Greenhand, of whom most prominent Reachmen families claim descent. With so many families striving for prominence in a wealthy land, the ties that bind them are stronger and more important than elsewhere in Westeros."
 agot_tradition_riverlander_name:0 "Turmoil on the Trident"
 agot_tradition_riverlander_desc:1 "The Trident is a land that has seen much warfare throughout its long history, its central position making it a battlefield for wars not even of its own making. It has changed hands many times, with both Stormlanders and Ironmen invading and subjugating the Riverlords. This continual adversity has taught the Rivermen to use their homeland to their advantage, both in war and peace."
 agot_tradition_shieldman_name:0 "Guarding the Mander"
 agot_tradition_shieldman_desc:1 "Named after their primary function as a shield against Ironborn attacks, the Shield Isles are a collective of four well fortified Islands of the Reach, overseen by four separate houses. A loyal (although arguably isolated) people, those of the Shield Isles are known for their hardy temperaments and sense of duty. The Islands are famous for their beacons, which elders in watchtowers will light island by island to spread warning of incoming longships to inland settlements. Above all else, those from the Shield Isles value themselves as a first line of naval defense. "
 agot_tradition_stone_dornish_name:0 "Guarding the Passes"
 agot_tradition_stone_dornish_desc:1 "The Stone Dornish are ethnically and culturally the least Rhoynar-influenced of the Dornish. Living in the heights and valleys of the Red Mountains, their culture has been shaped by their generations of conflict with the Marcher lords of the Reach and Stormlands, ardently defending their mountain passes from outside incursions."
 agot_tradition_stormlander_name:0 "Rolling Thunder"
 agot_tradition_stormlander_desc:1 "The men of the Stormlands are renowned for being as harsh and thunderous as its weather. The Stormlanders live rugged lives in the hilly terrain of their homeland, shaping them into some of the strongest and hardiest warriors in Westeros. Beyond warfare, the stormy seas of Shipbreaker Bay produce weathered, hardy seamen." 
 agot_tradition_valeman_name:0 "Mountain and Vale"
 agot_tradition_valeman_desc:1 "The Vale of Arryn is, more than any other part of Westeros, the most deeply influenced by the Andals. The Vale’s knights are said to be the greatest in Westeros and its people the most pious. It is also a place of great fertility and abundance, the valleys between the Mountains of the Moon being second only to the Reach’s farmland."
 agot_tradition_vineman_name:0 "Wine, Women, and Song"
 agot_tradition_vineman_desc:1 "Ever since the coming of Gilbert of the Vines, the men of the Arbor have known but one thing; wine. The vineyards of the Arbor are legendary in Westeros and beyond for the quality wine they produce, and many a merchant and sailor set their anchors in Ryamsport to buy the finest Arbor reds. " 
 agot_tradition_westerman_name:0 "Of Gold and Silver"
 agot_tradition_westerman_desc:1 "The Westerlands, at first glance, seems a paltry place; not the largest or most populace of the Seven Kingdoms, it nevertheless is the wealthiest. What it lacks in rolling fields of fertile farmland, it more than makes up for with the bounty of its hills, rich with gold and silver. It is this abundance of valuable minerals that the power of the Westerlands is built upon, and its nobles jealously guard their mines against those who look on, envious of their abundance." 
 agot_tradition_barrowman_name:0 "Rills and Hills"
 agot_tradition_barrowman_desc:1 "While the barrowlands were once ruled by the dynasty of the Barrow Kings, its people assimilated with the rest of the Northmen following the dynasty’s submission to Winterfell at the end of their thousand year conflict. Barrowmen are eminent horsemen, with the area’s vast rolling plains making the Barrowlands ripe for cavalry warfare, which in turn makes Barrowmen valuable allies for anyone wishing to conduct warfare in the north."
 agot_tradition_clawman_name:0 "Wild Men of the Claw"
 agot_tradition_clawman_desc:1 "The men of Crackclaw Point are some of the wildest south of the Neck. The blood of the First Men runs thick in their veins, and many customs of the First Men still survive with them. Aside from the Mountain Clansmen of the Vale, the Clawmen were the only First Men to resist the Andal invasion, only adopting the Faith of the Seven after intermarrying with the Andals."
 agot_tradition_crannogman_name:0 "Denizens of the Bog"
 agot_tradition_crannogman_desc:1 "The Crannogmen are a squat, secretive people, seen as primitive by some and feared and derided as mudmen and bog devils by others. Their homeland, the Neck, is a large, swampy fen, thick with foliage and canopy. Few know what happens in the depths of the Neck, though many in Westeros whisper that the Crannogmen learned all manner of magic and sorcery from the Children of the Forest. Some go even further and state the Crannogmen themselves are born of the union between the Children and the First Men."
 agot_tradition_firstman_name:0 "The First"
 agot_tradition_firstman_desc:1 "Before the Seven Kingdoms, the Doom of Valyria, and even the Andals, there were the First Men. Wielding swords and axes of bronze, the First Men were the first of all men to settle Westeros, carving their culture and influence deep into the blood of the continent and all those who came after them. While the old tongue is still spoken by free folk and giants, their runic system of writing has gone extinct, along with many old tales that failed to be passed down orally. While echoes of the culture of the First Men can be found all around Westeros, it's strongest in the North, where Northmen can still be found praying to heart trees in a godswood, just as the First Men did. "
 agot_tradition_hill_clansman_name:0 "Clans of the North"
 agot_tradition_hill_clansman_desc:1 "The Hill Clansmen are some of the wildest and least civilized people south of the Wall. Infighting and clan rivalries are common amongst the clans, both large and small; this cycle of feuds and retribution having spilled untold blood throughout the centuries. Due to their proximity to the wall, the Clansmen have strong binds with the Night's Watch and interact with the Wildlings through raiding and trading more than any other peoples south of the Wall."
 agot_tradition_northman_name:0 "Loyal and True"
 agot_tradition_northman_desc:1 "The Northmen are some of the last of the First Men and by far the largest populace still in existence. Protected from the Andal invasions by the impassible terrain of the Neck and the fortress of Moat Cailin. The Northmen were left to their ancient traditions, still worshipping the Old Gods. To this day, the Northmen are an isolationist people, rarely concerning themselves with affairs south of the Neck."
 agot_tradition_sisterman_name:0 "Beneath the Brine"
 agot_tradition_sisterman_desc:1 "For much of their history, the Sistermen had more in common with the Ironborn than the men of the Vale or North. For millennia the Sistermen were ruled by their pirate-kings, pillaging along the shores of the bite to provide for themselves what their windswept isles could not, worshipping strange deities unknown to both the Andals and First Men."
 agot_tradition_skagosi_name:0 "Children of Stone"
 agot_tradition_skagosi_desc:1 "The Skagosi, known derisively as “Skaggs” to many outsiders, are closer to Wildlings than civilized folk to most people. To themselves, they are the Stoneborn, a proud people making the best of the rugged rocks they call home. They are rumoured by many to carry on some of the darker and more savage traditions of the First Men, including cannibalism and human sacrifice."
 agot_tradition_ironborn_name:0 "Salt and Rock"
 agot_tradition_ironborn_desc:1 "The Iron Isles are undoubtedly a rugged, barren place. This fact is mirrored succinctly by its people. The culture of the Ironborn is built upon reaving, paying the iron price. Lacking arable land on their rocky outcroppings, the Ironmen have taken to the sea since time immemorial, those without the constitution for warfare becoming fisherfolk. Attending to the scant farms of the Iron Isles are its thralls, for farming is seen to be beneath even the smallfolk."
 agot_tradition_greenborn_name:0 "From Sea and Field"
 agot_tradition_greenborn_desc:1 "Ironborn who have settled more inland. While still holding onto a fondness for the sea, they have become more adapt at living away from it."
 agot_tradition_valyrian_name:0 "Blood of the Dragon"
 agot_tradition_valyrian_desc:1 "The Valyrians were once an innumerable people, with an empire stretching from Ghis to Pentos. The Freehold, despite its name, however, was anything but. While tolerant of the peoples they subjugated on Dragonback, this tolerance did not stop them from enslaving hundreds of thousands, sending them to despair in the mines of the Fourteen Flames. With the Doom, however, all but a few of the pure-blooded Valyrians were snuffed out, alongside the dragons they’d used to conquer and subdue."
 agot_tradition_rhoynish_name:0 "Children of the Mother Rhoyne"
 agot_tradition_rhoynish_desc:1 "Rhyonish civilization is ancient and illustrious. So deep is the history of the Rhoynar that some credit them with teaching the Andals how to smith and work with Iron. Hailing from the city-states along the river Rhoyne, the Rhoynar worship numerous gods of the river and also have a special affinity for all manner of boats, from small fishing vessels to obscene pleasure barges. Rhyonish culture is notably different from that of the Andals, with equal inheritance being the norm for both women and men, and same sex relations being accepted. The Rhoynar are known for embracing works of art and music, which may be partially why some Rhoynar cultural practices were so quick to catch on when the Rhone arrived in Dorne. "
 agot_tradition_greenblood_name:0 "Fluvial Orphanage"
 agot_tradition_greenblood_desc:1 "After fleeing Essos and arriving in Dorne, the Orphans of the Greenblood earned their self imposed titles by refusing to adopt Dornish customs and assimilate, choosing instead to live as the ‘orphans’ of the river Rhoyne — the river they call ‘mother.’ The Orphans of the Greenblood and their descendants cling to Rhoynar culture and beliefs, still speaking the Rhoynish Tongue behind closed doors and in secrecy, living on rafts along the river Greenblood from which they take their name. "
 agot_tradition_salt_dornish_name:0 "The Blood of Nymeria"
 agot_tradition_salt_dornish_desc:1 "With the most Rhoynar blood flowing through their veins of any Dornishmen, the Salt Dornish live on the more temperate coastlands of Dorne. They carry on many of the egalitarian traditions brought to Dorne by Nymeria and make for fine sailors, the ports spotting the Dornish coast bringing them much prosperity."
 agot_tradition_sand_dornish_name:0 "Desert and Dune"
 agot_tradition_sand_dornish_desc:1 "Eking out their existence in the harsh desert that they call home, the Sand Dornish are resilient, ruthless people. Their castles and settlements are based around the rare sources of water in their desert homeland, which they ardently defend. They are a naturally daring and adventurous people, with many of the noble houses in the region descending from those brave few who set out on expeditions into the harsh dunes."
 agot_tradition_wildling_name:0 "Savage, Wild, and Enchanted"
 agot_tradition_wildling_desc:1 "Despite their name and reputation, the Wildlings from beyond The Wall are far from uncivilized, although that may depend on one’s definition of what it is to be ‘civil.’ Although mostly differing from the ways of the ‘kneelers’ from the Seven Kingdoms, the Wildlings are capable of being just as organized as those south of The Wall — if not more organized, depending who you ask. Customs and practices differ between tribes and clans, and anyone brave enough to explore beyond The Wall will find everything from chieftains to lords, known as ‘Magnars’ in the Old Tongue. Despite the diversity, however, Wildlings are seemingly able to agree on two things: Little is more valuable than a man who keeps his sworn word, and the dead must be burned."
 agot_tradition_westeros_valyrian_name:0 "Braving the Storm"
 agot_tradition_westeros_valyrian_desc:1 "The Valyrian folk of the Blackwater isles are in many ways more similar to the Andals than their progenitors from the Freehold. Rather than their wealth being built upon the backs of slaves digging deep in the fourteen flames, the Western Valyrians have long sought their wealth from the sea. They make for industrious merchants and are some of the finest sailors in Westeros."
 agot_tradition_krakenman_name:0 "Iron and Ice"
 agot_tradition_krakenman_desc:1 "Although part of the North, many maesters are of the belief that the blood of Cape Kraken’s seafaring people is closer to the Ironborn than it is of Northmen. The people of Cape Kraken find themselves at odds culturally, however. Although belonging to the north, their position below the neck leaves them feeling socially and culturally distant from the seat of Winterfell — while their bloodied history of being raided by the Ironborn sets them in opposition to those who many would assume were their salt-watered kin. "
 agot_tradition_mountain_clansman_name:0 "Above the Setting Sun"
 agot_tradition_mountain_clansman_desc:1 "In the depths of the Mountains of the Moon dwell its clansmen, the most savage and uncivilized men anywhere south of the Wall. They are the last true remnants of the First Men in the Vale, their mountainous home protecting them from the onslaught of the Andals, leaving them to continue their primitive ways without much outside intervention."
 agot_tradition_wolfswood_clansman_name:0 "In Deepest Depths"
 agot_tradition_wolfswood_clansman_desc:1 "A hardy and hard-working people, the people of the clans within the Wolfswood are known just for their rugged nature, but are also somewhat famed for their talents when it comes to ice-fishing. While they may not be grand houses, the clansmen of the Wolfswood’s blood runs as deep as any noble family — descended from the First Men, some of the clans have outlasted the woods itself, with some of it being reduced to ashes during an Ironborn raid. It’s said by some that some of the clans still practice the first night, with clan chiefs being considered ‘lords’ by their lieges — although this is more of a polite courtesy on the part of the liege, as clan chiefs do not consider themselves high-born"
 agot_tradition_bearman_name:0 "Among Bear and Pine"
 agot_tradition_bearman_desc:1 "The people of Bear Island are a hardy folk, long used to raids from both the Ironmen and the Wildlings. They have held the island since King Rodrik Stark, and will hold it longer. Such a life of constant struggle has led the women of the island taking up arms alongside their men, and said to be as fearsome as a she-bear with protecting her cubs."
 agot_tradition_rushlander_name:0 "Where Rivers meets Hills"
 agot_tradition_rushlander_desc:1 "A culture born on the border of the Vale and Riverlands. Rushlanders are a harty people adapt to lives in the hills, as well as, the rivers."
 agot_tradition_harsh_laws_name:0 "Harsh Rule"
 agot_tradition_harsh_laws_desc:1 "Society shapes the laws. History has shown it's natural for a harsh land to give rise to harsh people, and they in-turn make harsh laws to rule by."

 agot_tradition_thenn_desc:1 "Known as the more ‘sophisticated’ of the free folk by those south of the Wall, the Thenns consider themselves to be the last remaining First Men. The inhabitants of the mountain valley in the Frostfang peaks interact more with giants than they do other cultures, but have managed to learn the occasional word or sentence in Common Tongue, despite having never deviated from the Old Tongue they still speak today. Priding themselves in their belief in Magnar, the Thenn are somewhat more disciplined and organized than other free folk, and have managed to amass an impressive bronze armory. While those south of the Wall may consider the Thenn to be savage, they are more than capable, often coming to conflict with the Night’s Watch."
 agot_tradition_insular_marriage_name:0 "Insular Marriage"
