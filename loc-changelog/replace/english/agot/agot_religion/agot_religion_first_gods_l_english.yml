 bronze_gods_adj:0 "Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_adherent:0 "Worshipper of the Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_adherent_plural:0 "Worshippers of the Bronze Gods"
 bronze_gods_desc:0 "In times when iron and steel were not known of, bronze was the dominating metal for all purposes. Weapons, tools, and Gods. The people of this faith revere the High God of Bronze, and his two daughters of Tin and Copper. It is said that they once revealed themselves, and told a man how to create the alloy; urging, if not demanding, that he spread the word amongst his fellow mortals. It was conveyed by men of the clergy that creating bronze would bolster the God and his daughters' powers, hence gaining favour with them. This led to a sweeping conquest of neighbouring lands for the search for more resources they may turn into their holy metal."

 lady_of_the_waves_desc:0 "Before the arrival of the Andals and their worship of the Seven Who Are One, the native peoples of the Three Sisters worshipped their own gods, prime amongst them the Lady of the Waves, and her mate, the Lord of the Skies. She is revered as a lustful and demanding goddess, whose trysts with her mate are thought to cause the storms that plague the region.\n\nShe is known to demand her followers cast those born stunted or deformed into the sea, returning them to her domain, but her demanding nature is not without benevolence — or love for her worshippers. Those born with the mark of webbing between their digits are rewarded with her favor freely."
