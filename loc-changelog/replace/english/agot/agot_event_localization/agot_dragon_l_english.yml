 #Ride Your Dragon Normal Ride
 agot_dragon.0010.t:0 "Freedom of the Open Skies"
 agot_dragon.0010.night:0 "The moon hangs low in the obsidian sky, casting its silver glow upon the world below. [ridden_dragon.GetName] eyes me sleepily, nostrils flaring eagerly as [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] realizes my approach means an evening ride.\n\n[ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')|U] wings beat rhythmically against the shimmering stars, a symphony of power and grace, propelling us higher and higher. As we ascend, the world transforms beneath us. The forests below become a patchwork of shadow and silver, the rivers winding through them like glistening veins of ore.\n\nThe wind whips around us, a flowing roar beneath the percussive pulsing of [ridden_dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] wings. In the moonlight's embrace, I can feel the world's song within me — I am a composer, and [ridden_dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] flight is my melody."
 agot_dragon.0010.sili:0 "I step up to the saddle of [ridden_dragon.GetName], swinging my legs over and feeling [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] powerful muscles flex beneath me as I tighten the straps of my saddle. With a command and a surge, I feel [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] lurch upwards, and in seconds I am soaring through open skies.\n\nAs we break through the clouds, I feel the weight of the world fall from my shoulders... I know I must return, but not before enjoying the true exhilaration of dragonflight. I release the reins, and [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] screeches with delight at [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] newfound freedom, twirling upwards, wings outstretched. We hang weightlessly in the wide open sky, if only for a moment, while the world waits below."
 agot_dragon.0010.lord:0 "[ridden_dragon.GetName] takes flight, and in a few flaps of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings, we are both close to the skies. I leave behind me the heavy burden of my title. I let go of all responsibilities for a moment to rise above it all — to feel the caress of the wind and the kiss of the sun.\n\nRare are the moments when I can completely let myself go and live fully in the present, which makes this flight all the more exhilarating. [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] begins to twirl, and after a few moments of letting off steam, I command [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to rise again, and again, #italic and again#!.\n\nWe reach the highest peaks of the clouds. I close my eyes, extending my arms to their fullest, and here, far from everything, it's like #italic a new youth#!. [ridden_dragon.GetNamePossessiveNoTooltip] roar makes me understand that [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] is also delighted with the special time we are sharing."
 agot_dragon.0010.greeny:0 "[ridden_dragon.GetName] purrs with anticipation as I climb into [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] saddle. The connection with [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] is something I feel nowhere else, and with an unspoken command we are airborne.\n\n[ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] roars in approval as I pull the reins back, driving [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] higher #italic and higher#!. We climb as if pulled upwards by the gods themselves, and then break into silence — the only sound is the wind rushing over wings.\n\nUp here, above the clouds with the sun on my face, I am free. Free from duty, free from worry, and free from #italic all earthly burdens#!. I feel what I know every dragonrider has felt: the keen desire to keep flying, beyond the known world, endlessly chasing the horizon."
 agot_dragon.0010.troof:0 "With skies clear and the sun shining, today is the perfect day to spend some time on dragonback with [ridden_dragon.GetName]. I've sent for the dragonkeepers to ready my saddle ahead of time and dressed in my most comfortable riding attire.\n\nAs I approach, [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] lowers [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] neck to welcome me. I reach out to run my hand across [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonColorFull')] scales for a brief moment, in awe of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] majesty, before reaching toward and climbing the saddle to take my seat. While I lift my leg over the saddle to situate myself, I expel my nervous feelings through a long and drawn out breath.\n\nTo prepare for flight, I check that my footing is sure and I grip the handles of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] saddle firmly. Before I realize it we are far above the land, cutting the sky like Valyrian steel. Feeling the powerful might below and the wind above, I take in the splendor of the land and sea. What a wonder to behold!"
 agot_dragon.0010.tukha:0 "I reach out my hand to touch the clouds; dew drops coalesce. The profoundness of the droplets looms in my mind like the swelling storm on the horizon. Then the question strikes me: How few have experienced this sensation? Throughout all history, could their numbers fit in a single hall back home? Does anyone alive today know or am I alone in this experience?\n\n[ridden_dragon.GetName] dips [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wing into the cloud, as if aware of my thoughts, and I am forced to concede that [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] now shares in the moment as well. I could be mistaken, but it feels as though this concession brings [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] joy. There is a comfort to be found in that too I suppose; a reminder of the depth of our bond."
 agot_dragon.0010.aemmly:0 "King's Landing shrinks beneath me as [ridden_dragon.GetName] soars towards the clouds. [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')|U] excitement is magnetic, yet the beat of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings is as soothing as a heartbeat. I gaze across the Blackwater Bay and spot Driftmark and Dragonstone, the isles which bore the last remnants of Valyria for one hundred years, the size of rough cobblestones on the street.\n\nIt is all gone soon enough. [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] bursts through the clouds and all of a sudden the chaotic sprawling world beneath me is no more. A gentle breeze brushes against my skin and a feeling of ethereal peace washes over me, I cannot help but smile. [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] purrs cheerfully, as if to declare it is where [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] belongs. We savor the moment, but it cannot last forever."
 agot_dragon.0010.harrenhal:0 "[ridden_dragon.GetNamePossessive] saddle is already ready when I arrive. So much the better, I can't wait to go take a breath of fresh air, far from this cursed castle. These gloomy rooms and this disturbing aura quickly become heavy.\n\nAs I draw closer to the clouds, I can't shake this strange feeling, as if something was watching me. I briefly glance behind me, as if to make sure that the ghost of Harren himself has not followed me; even here, at this altitude, his fortress seems imposing. Such gigantism... I must wait to break through the clouds before I'm rid of their immoderation.\n\nA veil of clouds becomes my rampart against the oppression of Harrenhal, whose colossal size is no match for the immense freedom of the open skies. Even the many horrors that this cursed castle inflicts on me cannot weaken the bond that unites me to [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip]!"
 agot_dragon.0010.oldtown:0 "The Hightower lives up to its name. It takes a while for [ridden_dragon.GetName] to use [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings to crest the top. There, we circle around, as if [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] has become a mere moth, attracted by the flame of a candle.\n\nIt may be true that dragons are fire-made-flesh, and none doubt their inherently dominance... so perhaps this gigantic beacon looming over all around it evokes something familiar to [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')].\n\nBoth are a symbol. One, what man can create; the other, what nature can create. Two entities that inspire respect and fear. To know that I have managed to form a bond with such delights me to the #italic highest#! degree."
 agot_dragon.0010.coastal:0 "With my hands flat on [ridden_dragon.GetName], my head pressed against [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], I feel life flowing through [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] body — a life shared by our connection. I smile at [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], and I could swear [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] smiles back, in the language specific to dragons.\n\nWithout delay, we take flight. While we could easily get lost in the immensity of the skies, flying and twirling alongside the clouds, [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] takes me toward the sea. Another immensity, just as magnificent.\n\n[ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')|U] speed is such that it creates a ripple on the surface of the water. The fish, fleeing, disperse as we pass, while the dolphins, more playful, swim alongside us. With a sudden and powerful beat of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings, [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] rises, where even the most mischievous dolphin cannot follow us."
 agot_dragon.0010.cloudforest:0 "[ridden_dragon.GetName] spreads [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings, indicating that [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] is ready to fly. I give [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] a few affectionate pats of approval, and [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] bursts into the sky.\n\nSoon, we are among the cloud forests, where visibility is hampered by thick foggy masses — but today it seems particularly dense, as if #italic something#! is encouraging us to return rather than fly. Here, alone, I can feel the bond that unites us without any interference. [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] can sense my frustration through our connection, and as if to free me from it, [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] unleashes the fire vigorously.\n\nThese misty masses are nothing other than drops of water, and fire cannot bend before water — #attacker_color not dragonfire#!. All the surrounding mist is dispersed... or rather, swept away by the incandescent jet. This innocuous gesture, for a dragon, reminds all of the power of these divine creatures: #italic Even nature must bend to their will.#!"
 agot_dragon.0010.frozenflats:0 "[ridden_dragon.GetName] and I have been in the air for a while when [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] begins to dive closer to the icy ground. Powerful flapping of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings allowed [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to slow [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] fall, before placing [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] clawed feet on the ice. At that moment, [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] began to slip.\n\nI wouldn't have expected this to excite [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], but it does! Without realizing it, this dragon ride has become a sliding session. I slide out of my saddle to take advantage of the ice myself. Childish leisure certainly, but shared with [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] it bothers not me. When [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has had enough, [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] digs [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] claws firmly into the ice, to be sure of [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] balance.\n\nAs I am about to get back into the saddle, I notice [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] lower [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] head to look at [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] reflection on the ice. I do the same, but rather than my own face, I see only [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_dragon.0010.urban1a:0 "Without much ado, [ridden_dragon.GetName] carries me high above the city. For this ride, I feel — no, I know; I know it because #italic I feel it#! — that [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] does not want to get lost in the immensity of the sky. What [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] wants is to fly over the city, and thus dominate the place and its inhabitants. All dragons have within them this deep instinct — at times, buried — of domination over what surrounds them.\n\n"
 agot_dragon.0010.urban1b:0 "Without much ado, [ridden_dragon.GetName] jolts us skyward. Below, the city is teeming with life. All these people, caught up in their activities, circulating through the streets — like the blood boiling in the veins of a dragon. It is undoubtedly this excitement that pushed [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to stay so close to the city that I could almost clearly see the contemplative faces of the populace.\n\n"
 agot_dragon.0010.urban2a:0 "No matter how many times I ride [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], there never cease to be smallfolk who turn up their noses as we pass by. Because this is the only way for the common people to be in our place: imagination. They do not have the privilege that the dragonriders have.\n\n"
 agot_dragon.0010.urban2b:0 "The smallfolk cannot pretend not to see such a creature flying over them. They all roll their eyes at the sky... No matter how many times they have seen this spectacle, the common people know that they will never have the privilege of being a dragonrider.\n\n"
 agot_dragon.0010.urban3a:0 "These peasants will never know this power, this glory. It is reserved for me and my ilk. Dragonriders should not — no, #italic can#! not — feel pity for the smallfolk. This is a gift from [ridden_dragon.GetNameNoTooltip] to #italic me#!."
 agot_dragon.0010.urban3b:0 "They will never know what it feels like to ride such a creature, nor understand the bond that unites me to [ridden_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')].

 agot_dragon.0010.urban3c:0 "Forever they will remain... merchants, blacksmiths, weavers, butchers, whatever. Jobs that — while useful — will never open the doors to absolute freedom for them.

I only have a moment to speculate on what sort of terrible or mundane fate they may have encountered before the soul-burning sound resonates in the cavity. The cries of a thousand souls burn my bones to ash — or at least that is what it feels like.\n\nIn the silence that follows, there is much confusion, confusion that turns to shock as [candidate_one.GetFirstName] cries out, pointing to the ghastly sight of [false_seed.GetFirstName].

A moment of silence passes, then a moment more. No dragons cry out, nor wings beat in the distance. The candidates look to me for guidance on whether to continue the Sowing."
