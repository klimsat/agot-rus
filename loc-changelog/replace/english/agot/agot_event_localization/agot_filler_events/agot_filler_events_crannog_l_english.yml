 agot_filler_crannog.0001.t:0 "Foreigner Stuck in the Neck"
 agot_filler_crannog.0001.desc:0 ""Help, help me," a voice cries out.\n\nPeering through the thick vines and trees, I can make out a southerner caught in a series of brambles, bushes, and branches. His pouch is torn open at his feet, and his skin is littered with a number of scraps and bruises. I watch him for a while, and realize he must have taken a detour off the main road. Perhaps he thought he could take a shortcut through the wilderness of the Neck.\n\nHe continues shouting, each plea more desperate and wild than the last. I have to move on, but leaving him hear shouting would be a cruelty... Not to just him, but to other Crannogmen and even the swamp itself..."
 agot_filler_crannog.0001.a:0 "He is a nuisance to this area; I have to get him out."
 agot_filler_crannog.0001.b:0 "Leave him. Let the Neck deal with its problems on its own."
 agot_filler_crannog.0001.c:0 "Help him and show him the way yourself."
 agot_filler_crannog.0001.d:0 "The lizard-lions in this area need to be fed..."

 agot_filler_crannog.0002.t:0 "Foreigner Stuck in the Neck"
 agot_filler_crannog.0002.desc:0 "As I emerge from the tree line, I announce my presence. The southerner is wholly bewildered, afraid even. I am perhaps the first Crannogman he has ever seen in his life.\n"You're one of them bog men they mentioned at the T-Twins, aren't you?" he whimpers, eyeing the frog spear across my back. I take a knife from my belt and cut away the branches he is caught on. I pick up his pouch and hand it to him. I tell him that he will need to follow me closely to return to the Kingsroad.\n\nWe walk silently for some time before finally coming upon a seldom-traveled path. I point to it and tell him it will take him straight to the Kingsroad. All he has to do is follow it directly. I warn him that trouble will find him if he strays from it, and I leave before he can respond."
 agot_filler_crannog.0002.a:0 "Good riddance."

 agot_filler_crannog.0003.t:0 "Foreigner Stuck in the Neck"
 agot_filler_crannog.0003.desc:0 "As I emerge from the tree line, I shout to announce my presence. I give a friendly wave and smile as I approach and tell him, as clearly as I can, that I'm going to help him to safety. He is still on edge, clearly having never seen a Crannogman before, but it seems he trusts me to help him with this predicament.\n\nAfter I cut the branches away from him, I hand him some salted meat and some of my fresh water. Soon enough, he is not only following me but also merrily conversing with me. I learn a great deal about him, his family, and his role as a trader. He has apparently traveled across Westeros all his life, but never to the North before.\n\nAfter a few more hours of travel, we come across a decaying path. I tell him this is where we part ways, this path leading back to the Kingsroad. He shakes my hand and tells me that the Seven will reward me for my good deed. I bid him farewell..."
 agot_filler_crannog.0003.a:0 "It's rewarding to help those in need."

 agot_filler_crannog.0004.t:0 "Foreigner Stuck in the Neck"
 agot_filler_crannog.0004.desc:0 "As the southerner continues to shout for help, I chuckle, appreciating the fear and panic in his voice. I walk over to a nearby water hole and spot exactly what I am looking for... #bold several large lizard-lions#!.\n\nI emerge from the tree line and tell the southerner I will help him. I cut away the branches and brambles and take his arm firmly, reassuring him that I would get him back to the path. He is mumbling about me being a bog devil or something; I just nod and smile. \n\nI drag him to the water hole, and when he realizes what is happening, I push him in, #italic hard#!. I back up and watch as the hungry lizard-lions dive into the water and begin to rip him to pieces. This will be an enjoyable hour."
 agot_filler_crannog.0004.a:0 "It's rewarding to help the local wildlife."

 agot_filler_crannog.0006.t:0 "Bog Body Found"
 agot_filler_crannog.0006.desc:0 "The wars of the realm have brought me and my army to the Neck. It is a green hell, aye, but nonetheless, we find ourselves here.\n\nToday, we have made camp on a peat bog. As I walk through camp, I come across several soldiers crowding around a hole in the ground. I push through the crowd and see them standing over a severely tanned body. It's dressed in ancient, regal clothing. His red hair is uncouth, but parted so that the seven-pointed star tattoo on his forehead is visible. The rope he was hanged with is still attached to his neck.\n\nOur local guide comes over and is not surprised to see the body. He tells us that sometimes the bogs of the Neck can preserve bodies from long ago. Pointing to the body in the hole, he tells us that he was an Andal warlord — killed while trying to conquer the Neck thousands of years ago. Some of the men around us hoot with laughter, thinking our guide is telling us a jape, but he is dead serious..."
 agot_filler_crannog.0006.a:0 "While interesting, a body is a body. Bury it and leave it."
 agot_filler_crannog.0006.b:0 "I hope I don't end up entombed in this bog forever."
 agot_filler_crannog.0006.c:0 "He is an example of what happens to those who invade the Neck!"
 agot_filler_crannog.0006.d:0 "Send him to the Great Sept, he deserves a proper funeral."

 agot_filler_crannog.0007.opening:0 "Heroes of the Seven"
 agot_filler_crannog.0007.desc:0 "To the wise [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U] [ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltipRegnal], I have received the body you discovered while on campaign in the Neck. Your discovery of this devout warrior greatly pleases me. Finally, after thousands of years, this legendary hero of the Seven is home, away from the lands of the bog devils. Your deeds shall not be forgotten."
 agot_filler_crannog.0007.a:0 "I am grateful for this commendation."

 agot_filler_crannog.0008.desc:0 "As my men and I trudge through one of the thousand swamps in the Neck, we wearily enter a dense thicket. All around us are fallen logs, enormous trees, twisted vines, and ferns that dwarf men. We cannot see through to the other side.\n\nAs we slowly progress down the path, one of the forward men shouts, #bold #N "LIZARD-LION!"#!#! I stomp my way forward and see a #italic massive#! scaly beast sizing up some of my party members. The beast is at least the size of six men put together. It could easily swallow me whole and still have room for the two men behind me...\n\nIt's blocking my party's way... my men are asking what we should do."
 agot_filler_crannog.0008.a:0 "We have to kill it. We could even sell the meat."
 agot_filler_crannog_.0008.a.flavor:0 "You and your men will attack the beast."
 agot_filler_crannog.0008.b:0 "We have to risk it off-path."

 agot_filler_crannog.0009.t:0 "Attack!"
 agot_filler_crannog.0009.desc:0 "Attempting to attack a massive creature will be very difficult, especially when we are on his home turf. Nonetheless, I draw my sword and tell my companions to prepare themselves.\n\nI motion for one of my men to throw a rock at the creature to draw its attention; he's standing by, waiting for my signal. The rest of my men silently nod to me, their swords tight in their hands..."
 agot_filler_crannog.0009.a:0 "Kill it!"

 agot_filler_crannog.0010.t:0 "Into the Swamp!"
 agot_filler_crannog.0010.desc:0 "I tell my men to scatter into the thicket. I am not willing to risk fighting a massive beast in its own environment. We will traverse the thicket and meet ahead.\n\nI watch as my men all disappear into the ominous swamp, fading behind trees and vines, and then I plunge in after them... Time to navigate through this mess."

 agot_filler_crannog.0011.desc:0 "The daughter of a powerful Crannogman magnate in the outskirts of [crannogfiller_location0011.GetName] was killed by a lizard-lion. The girl's death is being blamed on my apparent lack of care for the outer and rural villages in [crannogfiller_location0011.GetName]. Many claim that I am letting beasts run amok right outside my capital...\n\nThe story has spread like wildfire across my domain, and my advisors are urging me to do something."

I've decided to take a few hours to myself and wander around in a comfy little bog, taking in nature and enjoying the raw wilderness away from the castles and people.\n\nAs I'm idly walking, I spot a jumping white critter in the corner of my eye. I slowly turn around and see a giant albino bullfrog staring past me. I crouch down and approach it and take in its majesty... after all, an albino creature like this is not long to live out here."
 agot_filler_crannog.0012.a:0 "Pet it."

 agot_filler_crannog.0014.desc:0 "#bold OUCH! #! As I walk across a muddy and mossy patch of earth, my foot hits something solid, and #italic hard #!. It appears something is buried under the mud...\n\nI grab a stick and begin scooping the earth away, eager to see what the hidden object is. After a little bit of elbow grease, I pull out the decrepit shaft of a spear! The spearhead is still attached and intact, but it is clear the spear is ancient, dull, and useless. Looking at the spear closer, it is evident that it once belonged to a Crannogman warrior years ago. There would be no practical use in keeping it; after all, it's too old to use. But keeping an ancient artefact would make many envy me..."
 agot_filler_crannog.0014.a:0 "Keep it."
