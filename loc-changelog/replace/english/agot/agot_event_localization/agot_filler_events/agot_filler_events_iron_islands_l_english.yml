 # STRANGE ISLAND 100-107
 agot_filler_ironislands.001.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.001.desc:0 "The life of an Ironborn is spent on the waters, taking what we can from wherever we find it. We need not pay in gold for that which we can claim through force.\n\nToday, in the distance, I spot an odd island that I cannot recall having seen before. As my ship draws nearer, I can make out the shape of a temple on the stony shores."
 agot_filler_ironislands.001.a:0 "An abandoned temple can be easily pillaged..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.001.a.tt:0 "You make your way to shore and see what can is ripe for the taking."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0011.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0011.desc:0 "As we approach the abandoned temple, something feels amiss — like the air itself is heavy, though there is no sign of fog. I can't shake this foreboding feeling.\n\nThe closer we get, the heavier the air feels... Like ghastly hands pulling at my arms and back. #italic That's it, I can't go any further,#! I think to myself, before turning on my heel and scrambling back to my ship.\n\nMy men are left staring at me from the shore as I clamber on board, but at least I know I am #bold safe#!."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0011.a:0 "Curse these ruins!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0011.a.tt:0 "You depart the strange island immediately, never knowing what magic held its power there."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.desc:0 "As we approach the abandoned temple, something feels amiss — like the air itself is heavy, though there is no sign of fog. But my men and I press on.\n\nWe enter the temple; a massive chamber opens before us. Somehow it seems bigger inside... All around are eerie signs in a glyphic language.\n\nBut there, in the center of the room, rests a #bold massive, glowing jewel#!."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.a:0 "Ooh, shiny!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.a.tt:0 "You came all this way, time to take what you've found."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.b:0 "This place is cursed..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0012.b.tt:0 "You leave the gemstone undisturbed, departing the island immediately."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0013.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0013.desc:0 "I slowly awaken, feeling as though I'm fighting through a dense fog of my own mind.\n\n#italic Where am I?#! I wonder as I look around. A lone man stands next to a large sow in the distance... I begin walking toward them, my feet seeming to carry me on their own.\n\n"Son," the mysterious man intones as I draw near. "I've been waiting for you. Supper is almost ready. Tomorrow the harvest starts, and I will need you.""
 agot_filler_ironislands.0013.a:0 "What in the ...?"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0013.a.tt:0 "Your trip continues..."

 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.desc:0 "My eyes are closed once again. My body feels heavy, my mind agitated. There's some sort of #bold fluid#! flowing down my arms, onto my legs, and dripping onto the ground below. The droplets seem to carry away my anxieties.\n\nAs I fall deeper into my own mind, I feel nothing but peace and ecstasy...\n\nSuddenly, my eyes snap open, and before me stands #bold my liege!#!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.a:0 "I can explain! #bold This isn't really me!#!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.a.tt:0 "Your journey continues..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.b:0 "Please just #italic kill#! me."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0014.b.tt:0 "Your journey continues..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.desc:0 "I awaken once more, this time in a dark, cool alley. This port looks familiar, yet unknown. There is only one path forward, into the main town square. My feet carry me once more...\n\nAs I burst from the alleyway, I find myself surrounded by people — not just any people, they all seem to be ... #N me?!#!\n\nThey are chanting, shouting at me. #bold "Apathy is death!"#!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.a:0 "APATHY IS DEATH!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.a.tt:0 "You join their chorus."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.b:0 "Are those pumpkins?"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0015.b.tt:0 "You are a bit distracted."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0016.t:0 "A Strange Island"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0016.desc:0 "My eyes are closed tightly as the scent of flowers covers me like a blanket. But another smell is there too — one familiar yet cloying.\n\nI open my eyes, and there she is. I'd recognize her foul presence a mile away. That ugly, whiny, troublesome, unbearable fiend..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0016.a:0 "Get away, you bitch!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0016.a.tt:0 "Your stress seems to melt away."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0017.t:0 "A Strange Journey"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0017.desc:0 "I jolt awake. I am lying upon the deck of my ship, surrounded by my crewmen.\n\nI've been unresponsive for days, one of my men tells me. Barking out ludicrous orders, dropping my trousers, muttering to myself...\n\nI even beat myself over my head with a bucket, but suddenly I snapped back! #italic Who knows when it might happen again?#!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0017.a:0 "Let's hope that is the last of it."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0017.a.tt:0 "And through all of this, you seem to have misplaced that beautiful jewel!"

 agot_filler_ironislands.002.desc:0 "We have not long set out on our voyage, the land beginning to fade into the distance, when [mutineer.GetFirstNameNicknamedNoTooltip] sets down his oar and starts to walk towards me. I can tell from the look in his eye that we're going to have a problem. Other crew members begin to gather round, some looking equally as disgruntled"
 agot_filler_ironislands.002.a:0 "Remind [mutineer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] of his place"
 agot_filler_ironislands.002.b:0 "Now hold on, how about we share some of the wealth"
 agot_filler_bribe_challenger.tt:0 "Your crew may lose some respect for you if you take the soft way out"

 agot_filler_ironislands.0021.desc:0 "With [mutineer.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] dealt with the situation seems to de-escalate. The crowd disperses and your followers look to you with renewed respect."

#A Storm of Iron 300-302
 agot_filler_ironislands.003:0 "A Storm of Iron"
 agot_filler_ironislands.003.desc:0 "It is always a beautiful thing to behold two ships in a bout. We sons of the Drowned God do not sow; we do not sit idly crafting trinkets as the greenlanders do. We plunder, take what is ours by right of strength. After all, if a man cannot defend what he holds dear to him, why should it be his?\n\nAnd as if by providence, we just so happened to have laid our sights on a lightly defended merchant fleet..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.003.a:0 "Get us closer, ram their flagship, right for their throat!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.003.a_tt:0 "To battle!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.003.b:0 "Drowned God! Guide our ships, our axes, spears and swords!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.003.b_tt:0 "Guide us through brutal war!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0031:0 "A Storm of Iron"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0031.desc:0 "Our ship rages on! By the power of the waves and by the might of our arrow volleys, we come tearing into the side of the merchant galley. The Reavers roar, their weapons sing, the clash of steel against steel slowly dying out as the greenlanders die like the cattle they are. They fought well, but as always, they fall before the might of Ironborn warriors.\n\nAs the fighting comes to a halt and the last of the men surrender, I walk across the deck towards the captain, beaten within an inch of his life."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0031.a:0 "Take his head; I'm in need of some new decoration"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0031.a_tt:0 "Grab him."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0032:0 "A Storm of Iron"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0032.desc:0 "I have broken the [ship_captain_culture.GetName] captain. Now all of this is mine for the taking."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0032.a:0 "We shall drown you in offering to the Drowned God. All your riches are now mine."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0032.a_tt:0 "I have paid the Iron Price."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0032.b:0 "It is good to be a reaver."

# The Importance of the Iron Price 400-407
 agot_filler_ironislands.004:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.004.desc:0 "Your local priest has brought you ill news: one of your reavers has enveloped himself in riches - in the riches of men that he did not fell by his own blade. He has forsaken the Iron Price and sullied our traditions. The priest wants him shunned."
 agot_filler_ironislands.004.a:0 "I'll attempt to reason with him."
 agot_filler_ironislands.004.a_tt:0 "Ah, the folly of youth."
 agot_filler_ironislands.004.b:0 "Not on this ship he won't. Off he goes."
 agot_filler_ironislands.004.b_tt:0 "This calls for discipline."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0041:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0041.desc:0 "As Marq comes into your cabin, you assertively ask him to sit down. Then, you explain to him carefully the importance of earning what you take, that paying the price for every jewel, every salt wife, and every piece of booty you earn helps mould you into a true Ironborn."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0041.a:0 "Thank you for listening. I hope my words were as clear as the sea today. There will be consequences otherwise."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0041.a_tt:0 "Let's hope he remembers."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0041.b:0 "I wish you to declare your actions to the crew. To set an example."

 agot_filler_ironislands.0042:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0042.desc:0 "Marq is in an alley with some wenches and friends, disgracing himself in public. As he notices you, he calls you a "stuck-up pig" mocking your honor."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0042.a:0 "What did you just say to me?!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0042.a_tt:0 "You will learn respect boy!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044.desc:0 "Your priest was supposed to fetch some wine for you, and as you go to his chambers, you find him dead in a pile of blood."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044.a:0 "Who could be behind this?"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044.a_tt:0 "Hmmm..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044.b:0 "Seize Marq. We shall drown him in honor to the Drowned God."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0044.b_tt:0 "The Drowned God will judge him."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0045:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0045.desc:0 "Marq has fallen in line. Your men seem to respect your use of force and enforcement of religious traditions."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0045.a:0 "That'll keep them in line."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0045.a_tt:0 "Hopefully."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0046:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0046.desc:0 "You're enjoying an ale at the tavern, while Marq and a few of his goons burst in with bloody blades in hand. "You should have stayed quiet and let me have my way with the gold, [GetPlayer.GetName].""
 agot_filler_ironislands.0046.a:0 "There's no way out. I have to fight for my life."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0046.a_tt:0 "It looks grim..."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0047:0 "The Importance of the Iron Price"
 agot_filler_ironislands.0047.desc:0 "My opponents lay dead and bloodied. I've made the tavern a whole mess. Thankfully the bartender, having recognized me as the lord, joined in and bashed one of Marq's lackeys with a bottle on the side of the head."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0047.a:0 "For your troubles, good man."
 agot_filler_ironislands.0047.a_tt:0 "It's great to be generous."

 #Thrall House No More - used to remove Thrall House dynasty modifier once criteria has been meet
 agot_filler_ironislands.005.t:0 "A Thrall House No More!"
 agot_filler_ironislands.005.desc:0 "I listen as others raised their cups and call out the names of more reputable Ironborn houses, several weaker than my own. I grab my own cup and raise it high, calling out the name of my own house.\n\nAs expected, some respond, those deep in their cups or loyal to me; others act as if I have said nothing. But I am not deterred. "Is my house not considered among the powerful of the Iron Islands?" None would dispute that.\n\n"Have not I, my father and his before him, reaved and fought alongside yourself and your own?" None would deny that.\n\n"My house does not claim descent from the Grey King; it is well known my ancestors were thralls and salt wives. Yet our banners strike fear into the greenlanders, our blood stains the Iron Islands in its defense! I ask you, has not my house paid the iron price to be considered more than thralls? Has the blood we shed not washed away that stained from our dynasty?"\n\nI knew my words had struck — as men from all Ironborn houses, great and small, raised their cups and called out my house."
 agot_filler_ironislands.005.a:0 "The stain of thralldom is gone."
 agot_filler_ironislands.005.a_tt:0 "After today, none on the Iron Islands will look down upon your house again for its origins."

 agot_filler_ironislands.006.desc:0 "I returned to my my great hall from a meeting with my councilors to a raucous, at the centre of which was my [gold_price.Custom('DaughterSon')] [gold_price.GetName]. [gold_price.GetSheHe|U] is at the centre of a gyre of chortling lickspittles, wearing an assortment of silks and jewels. My child tells a joke, and they titter again over their goblets overflowing with Arbor gold and Dornish red. Then one of them notices me lurking in the corner, and the laughter dies out of the room.\n\n"Hello [ROOT.Char.GetMotherFather]," [gold_price.GetName] hiccups and [gold_price.Custom('quirk_pos_present')]. "Care for a drink?""
 agot_filler_ironislands.006.a:0 "Did you pay the iron price for these baubles?"
 agot_filler_ironislands.006.b:0 "The Old Ways are more like guidelines than actual rules."
 agot_filler_ironislands.006.c:0 "Sea Salt in [gold_price.GetHerHis] lungs is the only cure for such a profligate"

 agot_filler_ironislands.007.desc:0 "The son of a thrall from [birthplace.GetNameNoTier] has being showing incredible prospect as an Ironborn. I hardly believed it until one of our best reavers took me down to the docks myself and I witnessed it with my own eyes.\n\nThe young [thrall.Custom('GirlBoy')] was born of a miner, but apprenticed to a fishing boat where [thrall.GetSheHe] showed the seamanship of a sailor twice [thrall.GetHerHis] years. I watched as [thrall.GetSheHe] clambered up the masts, hauled and reefed sails, spliced rope and even showed some minor skill in a mock finger dance. With the right heading, [thrall.GetName] could be a name which greenlanders all along the coast speak in hushed whispers."
 agot_filler_ironislands.007.a:0 "[thrall.GetSheHe|U] will make a fine retainer."
 agot_filler_ironislands.007.b:0 "[thrall.GetSheHe|U] must be a stray seed that I left in a wench one night!"
