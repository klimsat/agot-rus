 agot_filler_lys.0001.desc:0 "Walking the city streets of Lys, I remember why the Valyrians of the Freehold considered this island a paradise. A salty ocean breeze, warmed by the kiss of the Summer Sea sun and carrying citrusy scents, cradles me as I pass by perfumed gardens, pleasure houses beyond count, and sprawling private palaces.\n\nAll of this is the property of merchant princes and their competitors who rule the free city just as the lords of the Seven Kingdoms rule their inheritance. As my journey reaches its end I stand before the mountainous Temple of Trade at the heart of the city. It is a monument of undeniable majesty dedicated to the only god that matters in Lys: #bold the god of gold#!."

But before I can respond, my guards burst through the doors behind me.\n\nI rise to see them hauling what appears to be the saltiest sea dog ever plucked from the depths, dropping [pirate.GetHerHim] like a wet gull on the tiled floor before me. "This churl thought [pirate.GetHerHis] band of vermin might escape your justice after they failed to deprive you of your property. [pirate.GetHerHis|U] friends foolishly attempted to resist. This creature alone surrendered."\n\n[pirate.GetSheHe|U] had the sense to save [pirate.GetHerHis] skin while [pirate.GetHerHis] friends were willing to die for my treasure. Perhaps there is more to [pirate.GetHerHim] than I can see. Safer to gut [pirate.GetHerHim] and be done with it — yet I can't help but ask [pirate.GetHerHis] name. The scum's smile beams between broken teeth as [pirate.GetSheHe] answers, "[pirate.GetName]. A smuggler and a thief!" A curious sort of pride for a criminal. Could such a brash [pirate.GetWomanMan] have a use?"

 agot_filler_lys.0031.desc:0 "The bustling market squares and noisy forums of Lys sing today as I look out from my balcony. From this vantage, her fabled Valyrian architecture and myriad inhabitants look like children's toys.\n\nA long sip of sweet Lysene red reminds me there are more than toys available in the depths of Lys for those willing to descend from their palaces and seek them out."
 agot_filler_lys.0031.a:0 "Why not? Who knows what I may discover!"

What shall it be? Fine jewelry? Perhaps a tome for... oh but look at the craftsmanship on that piece..."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.travel_desc:0 "I look around the city in awe. As the merchants and hawkers lining the streets and tending their stalls begin to recognize who I am, I see a murmur ripple and swell through the throng as masters bark at servants to shower me in meaningless trinkets and curios all the while regaling me with their import.\n\nHow I love the market! What shall it be? Fine jewelry? Perhaps a tome for... oh but look at the craftsmanship on that piece..."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.jewelry_a:0 "The jeweler grins like a child on their nameday as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] hustles behind darkened drapes. I pace until I hear hurried footsteps and see the gnarled little [market_merchant.GetWomanMan] returning, arms filled with ebony boxes of all sizes.\n\nAfter arraying them on a counter [market_merchant.GetSheHe] lifts each lid to reveal a collection that would make even the mightiest of monarchs melt with admiration, and it takes me only a moment to seize upon the piece I truly crave..."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.jewelry_b:0 "The jeweler nods and smiles as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] begins touring me about [market_merchant.GetHerHis] shop. [market_merchant.GetSheHe] is a master of his craft, noticing my reaction to each piece [market_merchant.GetSheHe] offers and finally narrowing the choice to something I would have never thought to choose — but simply adore!"
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.jewelry_c:0 "The jeweler wheezes a bit before scratching [market_merchant.GetHerHis] chin in thought. Absently [market_merchant.GetSheHe] turns around to disappear behind a counter before tossing a few dusty crates of jewelry onto the table, taking a swig of something strong, and leaving me to my business."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.jewelry_d:0 "This paltry display is unbelievable. Who ever heard of an unsatisfied customer in Lys? The outrage! But I suppose they are only simple smallfolk..."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.book_a:0 "The maven's eyes grow wide with recognition as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] scurries away, clacking [market_merchant.GetHerHis] shoes up the stairs and opening what sounds like a large metal vault. [market_merchant.GetSheHe|U] calls out to me, and I venture up to see [market_merchant.GetHerHim] stand before a large metal door, held ajar to reveal a display of some truly rare reproductions and even a few first editions!"
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.book_b:0 "The book maven guides me gently through the sections explaining each one, as if a kindly old [market_merchant.GetWomanMan]. [market_merchant.GetHerHis|U] collection is impressive, but I think I know what I want."
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.book_c:0 "The kindly old [market_merchant.GetWomanMan] offers me a smile and ushers me to a section containing illuminated manuscripts and other less verbose texts. I love all the pretty pictures, but the fewer words the better."

 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.furniture_a:0 "The proprietor distinguishes my meaning immediately as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] leads me toward the section of the warehouse where I can see only the most desirable pieces are on display. [market_merchant.GetHerHis|U] selection is breathtaking, and some of the items truly unique!"
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.furniture_b:0 "Meandering through the warehouse, we take our time as we weigh each option and consider how it would accentuate — or ruin — my decor. At last I find a quality piece that will be sure to start conversations at court!"
 agot_filler_lys.0032.desc.furniture_c:0 "[market_merchant.GetHerHis|U] brow furrows as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] barks something to a nervous-looking attendant. The child takes one of my fingers and points me to a series of pieces in a simpler style."

 # 0033 - Jewelry

 agot_filler_lys.0033.desc:0 "As I drift from display to display each piece of jewelry looks more exquisite than the last. I narrow the field to a few choices when the wizened Lyseni jeweler who owns the corner shop waddles up to me with a crooked smile.\n\n"Come, take a look," [market_merchant.GetFirstName] beckons. "What do you find of interest?""
 agot_filler_lys.0033.desc.special:0 "\n\nNothing catches my fancy, and I let [market_merchant.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] know it. "Yes, yes! What excellent taste you have, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip]," [market_merchant.GetSheHe|l] replies. "I can tell you have a keen eye. Mayhaps you would be interested in this?""
 agot_filler_lys.0033.modifier_desc:0 "This character has recently visited the markets in [ROOT.Var('Lys').Province.GetName]."
 agot_filler_lys.0033.a:0 "You must have some pieces you only show your finest customers?"

 agot_filler_lys.0033.d:0 "How dreadful. Nothing seems to have caught my eye..."

 # 0034 - Books
 agot_filler_lys.0034.t:0 "Looking at Tomes and Scrolls"
 agot_filler_lys.0034.desc:0 "The guards at the door bearing greataxes stare me down as I wait in the alley before a private book collector's townhouse. As the maven opens the door to greet me, the brutes nod and wave me past to follow [market_merchant.GetHerHim] into a stunning foyer with a view to the second story.\n\nBooks of a certain age carry a distinct smell, and if my nose can be trusted this place must be filled with ancient knowledge. From floor to ceiling the walls are lined with all manner of scrolls and tomes that must have been gathered over generations!"
 agot_filler_lys.0034.desc.special:0 "\n\nBut I am no mere visitor. A mind like mine requires books like a sword needs a whetstone. "You must have something that you don't show just #italic any#! customer," I entreat. "Ah, yes, [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], I know just what you desire," [market_merchant.GetFirstName] offers."
 agot_filler_lys.0034.modifier_desc:0 "This character has been recently visited the markets in [ROOT.Var('Lys').Province.GetName]."
 agot_filler_lys.0034.a:0 "There #italic is#! some obscure knowledge I have been seeking..."
 agot_filler_lys.0034.b:0 "I wonder what the collector's recommendation will be?"
 agot_filler_lys.0034.c:0 "Knowledge is porridge, and I just need a bowl."
 agot_filler_lys.0034.d:0 "Are you selling books or leasing space to worms and mice?"

 # 0035 - Furniture
 agot_filler_lys.0035.t:0 "Looking at Furniture"
 agot_filler_lys.0035.desc:0 "As the rotund proprietor ushers me inside [market_merchant.GetHerHis] spacious warehouse situated near the harbor, a heady aroma of lumber and varnish leads me forward along rows of artisan-made pieces curated and displayed for only the most discerning clientele.\n\nThe collection is almost all in the bold, sensual Lysene style, and I spy some pieces so sensational they could be bartered for a cask of Arbor Gold!"
 agot_filler_lys.0035.desc.special:0 "\n\nYet still, I find myself in an extravagant mood. "Do you have anything in reserve? Something befitting of a [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip] like myself?" I announce my query loudly, and I see [market_merchant.GetFirstNamePossessive] eyes grow wide."
 agot_filler_lys.0035.modifier_desc:0 "This character has been recently visited the markets in [ROOT.Var('Lys').Province.GetName]."
 agot_filler_lys.0035.a:0 "Only the most exquisite craftsmanship will do."

What shall it be? Should I visit the alchemist? Oh look at the craftsmanship on that armor piece... What is that beautiful smell?"
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.alchemy_a:0 "The alchemist's glasses gleam in the lamplight as a trembling hand removes a key from a hidden pocket sewn into [market_merchant.GetHerHis] ragged leather apron. [market_merchant.GetSheHe|U] holds it close to [market_merchant.GetHerHis] chest as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] hobbles to a secret compartment [market_merchant.GetSheHe]'s hidden beneath the floorboards, then opens a safe therein to reveal [market_merchant.GetHerHis] private collection of vials, poultices, tinctures, and tonics with a greedy grin."
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.alchemy_b:0 "The old [market_merchant.GetWomanMan] scratches [market_merchant.GetHerHis] head in thought for a few moments before drifting about [market_merchant.GetHerHis] workshop, pulling all manner of bottles from shelves and cabinets before spilling a potpourri of potent potables onto the counter and spreading [market_merchant.GetHerHis] arms wide like a magister leading a feast."
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.alchemy_c:0 "The mad[market_merchant.GetWomanMan] utters a chuckle before throwing [market_merchant.GetHerHis] head back and cackling. [market_merchant.GetSheHe|U] begins coughing violently into [market_merchant.GetHerHis] hand as [market_merchant.GetSheHe] waves me over to a rack of delightfully colored bottles! I nod in approval. Perhaps [market_merchant.GetSheHe] is only a misunderstood genius after all?"
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.alchemy_d:0 "This paltry display is unbelievable. Who ever heard of an unsatisfied customer in Lys? The outrage! But I suppose they are only simple smallfolk..."
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.armory_a:0 "As I offer the mighty blacksmith the right compliment [market_merchant.GetSheHe] repays me with a humble smile, gestures for [market_merchant.GetHerHis] apprentices to continue their labour, and pulls back a heavy curtain to reveal a treasure trove of the bronze demi-god's finest wares!"
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.armory_c:0 "The experienced craftsman points [market_merchant.GetHerHis] outstretched hammer toward racks displayed across [market_merchant.GetHerHis] shop bearing fine works of all kinds. [market_merchant.GetSheHe|U] continues [market_merchant.GetHerHis] work alongside journeymen as I begin to look over the collection."

 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.perfume_b:0 "A quick clap from the perfumer summons a flock of lovely maidens each carrying a small vial. One by one they unleash aromatic clouds at my command as I walk down the line weighing each of the splendid options."
 agot_filler_lys.0040.desc.perfume_c:0 "The caked tart breaks composure at my request. [market_merchant.GetHerHis|U] distraught face contorts for only a moment before [market_merchant.GetSheHe] recovers and leads me to a window display bearing small, colorful, perfume bottles of a less complex design."

 agot_filler_lys.0041.desc:0 "Finally I track down the fetid tenement purported to be the workshop of a Lyseni alchemist. The structure itself might be dilapidated, but the thick wooden door must be well locked and bolted with all manner of mechanisms as I can hear a sequence of them sliding and unlocking on the other side after my presence is announced.\n\nOnce the process is complete the door swings wide to reveal an old [market_merchant.GetWomanMan] with wild, unkempt hair wearing a soot stained leather apron. [market_merchant.GetSheHe|U] beckons me further in while rubbing [market_merchant.GetHerHis] hands together with an excited giggle as I begin to look around what [market_merchant.GetSheHe] deigns to call a laboratory."
 agot_filler_lys.0041.desc.special:0 "\n\nTo most, the potions on display would be sufficient, but I'm of a keen mind. "Tell me, is there anything you sell to only an uncommon customer such as myself?" My wager pays off, as [market_merchant.GetFirstNamePossessive] grin grows wide."
