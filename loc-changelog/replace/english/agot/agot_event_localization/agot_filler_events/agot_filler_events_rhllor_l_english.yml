 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.t:0 "The Lord of Light"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.desc:0 "One inauspicious night you are left alone in your study, mulling over reports and the details usually left to lower men. Suddenly, your door cracks open and, without any ceremony, a woman walks in. She wears all red, her hair is fire, and she speaks in a deep, strangely melodic voice. She is beautiful, alluring, and for a moment you wonder if you have not fallen asleep. But when you blink, she is still there.\n\nThe Red Woman tells you of a prophecy, of a Lord of Light and a name you recognize from lessons long ago. Azor Ahai, the wielder of Lightbringer, born amidst salt and smoke and the savior of the known world.\n\nShe whispers into your ear, telling you that the time has come for you to finally achieve your glories, to fulfill the auguries already seen in temples as far away as Asshai. All you need do now is seize it..." 
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.a:0 "I will listen, but nothing more."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.b:0 "I must heed these signs..."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.b.tt:0 "...for the night is dark and full of terrors."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.c:0 "I must heed these signs...and #italic more#! besides..."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.d:0 "Begone, vile witch! You hold no sway over me!"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0001.e:0 "Guards! Assassin!"

 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.t:0 "Embracing the Light"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.desc:0 "Having embraced the Lord of Light, you stand apart from the rest of your house, whose beliefs remain rooted in the old ways.\n\nTo symbolize this profound change and your unwavering devotion to the Red God, you consider adopting a new sigil. This emblem would still pay homage to your noble house while reflecting the fiery essence and sacred flames of the Lord of Light. Will you seize this chance to let your faith shine through your banner, or will you retain the traditional arms of your family?"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.a:0 "Let the flames of R'hllor guide our banner."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0002.b:0 "I will keep our traditional arms."

 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.t:0 "The Red Priest of [current_location.GetNameNoTooltip]"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.desc:0 "As we make our way through the bustling streets of [current_location.GetNameNoTooltip], [companion.GetTitledFirstName] and I cannot help but notice the growing din ahead. The roar of the crowd gathered before us grows louder and louder — like a bonfire feasting upon too much kindling.\n\nBefore the crowd stands a red priest of R'hllor delivering a fiery address, leaving the audience in rapt abandon. [red_priest.GetHerHis|U] every word seems to drive listeners into more of a frenzy...\n\n#italic "The night grows dark around us, smothering the light in each of us... The Lord's light, the very flame of our existence, requires sacrifice!"#! [red_priest.GetFirstNamePossessive] booming voice cuts through the air as [red_priest.GetHerHis] eyes lock with mine own. "Ho! What do #italic we#! have #italic here#!? A mighty [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l] come to mingle with the commoners."\n\nThe sudden silence presses around us like a candle's flame snuffed out between two fingers, but my gaze remains locked on [red_priest.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]. "What would you give to the Lord of Light, to see his #italic true#! face?" #italic [red_priest.GetHerHis] eyes drift toward a lit pyre next to [red_priest.GetHerHim].#!"
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.a:0 "Only a [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]'s blood will do."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.b:0 "Surely the Lord of Light would accept [companion.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_filler_rhllor.0020.c:0 "I think it's time to get out of [current_location.GetNameNoTooltip]"
