 agot_filler_kingslanding.0039.desc:0 "Although in ruins, the Dragonpit that looms over the Hill of Rhaenys is nothing to sneeze at. Commissioned by King Maegor, the massive structure was built on top of the ruins of the Sept of Remembrance after Maegor had it razed to the ground. It was to serve as a stable for the dragons, with doors large enough for two dozen knights to ride through at once. However, after being stormed during the Dance of Dragons, the pit's dome fell and it was sadly abandoned."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0039.a:0 "This is something I want to see up close."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0039.b:0 "I have a beautiful view from where I am."

 agot_filler_kingslanding.0040.desc:0 "The ruins are mesmerizing in their grandeur, and I'm so distracted that I don't notice the wooden floors crumbling beneath me until I'm falling through it. Although the fall doesn't harm me, I find myself surrounded by ash and charred bones. Ew. I pull myself out from the mess and flee the Dragonpit all together.\n\nLater in the day, I recall how during the Great Spring Sickness, the bodies had been so many that the Pyromancer's Guild had to use the Dragonpit to burn the dead."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0040.a:0 "I don't think I'll ever be able to unsee all those bones..."

 agot_filler_kingslanding.0041.desc:0 "As I explore the Dragonpit, a young woman approaches me. At first, I think this is a strange place to meet such a nice young maiden, but then I remember the rumors that the Dragonpit is used by some for... intimate encounters, and this young woman seems quite interested in exploring much more than the Dragonpit."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0041.a:0 "I know just the little nook."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0041.b:0 "I'm just here to see the Dragonpit, no thank you!"

 agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.desc:0 "I cannot even begin to believe my eyes! Even as rubble, the craftsmanship that went into building such a place. Such a shame that it's lost to King Maegor's paranoia — but I can't help but marvel regardless."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.a:0 "I've truly been inspired!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.b:0 "If I apply myself, perhaps I can build something like this one day."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0042.c:0 "Such a sight takes my breath away!"

 agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.desc:0 "Eventually, I come across a homeless man taking shelter in the ruins. He has a beggar's bowl beside him with nothing but a few coins in it."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.a:0 "Here, buy yourself a warm meal."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.b:0 "I'll take those — you'd just waste all this coin anyway."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0043.c:0 "*Ignore the man.*"

# Balerion making a ruckus
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.cat_name:0 "Balerion"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.t:0 "Balerion! What a Menace!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.desc:0 "I hear a commotion coming from the courtyard, and when I go to investigate, I find Balerion, that notorious feline of King's Landing causing a ruckus. He's chasing a mouse around the courtyard, and the mouse is running for its life. As he races, he knocks into a servant carrying a try of food, and the tray goes flying. The food spills all over the ground, and the servant is left to clean up the mess. "Damned cat!" I hear the servant yell after the fiend.\n\nThat cat has proven a nuisance more than once! I should do something about it."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.a:0 "That kitty just needs a good home!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.a.f:0 "You will adopt Balerion, and he will be your loyal companion."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.b:0 "Perhaps it is time to practice my vivisection's..."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.b.f:0 "You will dissect Balerion, and learn the secrets of his nine lives."
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.c:0 "Come here cat! You'll get a swift kick!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.c.f:0 "You will kick Balerion, hoping to teach him some manners!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.d:0 "Awwww, look at the cute little kitty!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.d.f:0 "You will pet Balerion, and give him a little treat!"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.e:0 "Perhaps [giving_cat_child.GetFirstName] would like a new pet?"
 agot_filler_kingslanding.0044.e.f:0 "You will give Balerion to [giving_cat_child.GetFirstName] as a gift!"
