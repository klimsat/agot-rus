 agot_travel_events.0001.desc:0 "As we ride through the Riverlands, a three stories tall inn emerges from distance, right the crossroads.\n\nSoon, loud voices fill the air and so does the smell of baked cakes... a scent so sweet I can almost taste them. \n\nNo doubt, my fellow companions wouldn't mind some good rest."
 agot_travel_events.0001.a:0 "A fine place to rest tonight."
 agot_travel_events.0001.a.tt:0 "You make a stop at the inn."
 agot_travel_events.0001.b:0 "We shall rest once we reach our destination."
 agot_travel_events.0001.b.tt:0 "You continue your journey."

 agot_travel_events.0002.t:0 "Travel: The Inn"
 agot_travel_events.0002.desc:0 "We arrive at a most opportune time, the inn is full of life and roars with laughter.\n\nAt the back, I spot a group of knights drinking, and by the look of their faces, they must have arrived long before us... Perhaps I could join them? \n\nTo my side, [fellow_traveler.GetName] invites me to share mead, mayhaps I could take the opportunity to spend more time with [fellow_traveler.GetHerHim] outdoors instead?"
 agot_travel_events.0002.a:0 "I'll keep to my fellows."
 agot_travel_events.0002.gregarious:0 "Innkeeper! I shall require your finest brews!"

 agot_travel_events.0003.desc:0 "Among the boisterous group, I meet [sellsword.GetFullName], who appears to be the leader of the band. [sellsword.GetHerHis|U] sullen face quickly reveals [sellsword.GetHerHis] troubles.\n\n"Truth be told, my [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], we've had less success than I had hoped. Most of my men are either dead or have deserted. If I don't find a contract to occupy the rest soon, I fear they will all leave... or worse."\n\nAfter guzzling another round, [sellsword.GetSheHe] adds: "Perhaps this life is not right for me and it would be for the better, at least I'd have a chance to return home." Yet, despite his bitterness I can see a glimpse of determination in his eyes..."
 agot_travel_events.0003.a:0 "Despair not, I have just the job for you."
 agot_travel_events.0003.b:0 "I'll hire your men, go and be free."

 agot_travel_events.0004.desc:0 "As I approach the table, the face of the biggest knight goes all red, suddenly [drunk_knight.GetSheHe] jumps from [drunk_knight.GetHerHis] seat and yells: "Well, well! Look who it is! [ROOT.Char.GetName] [ROOT.Char.GetHerselfHimself]!"\n\nThough [drunk_knight.GetSheHe] seems to know me, I cannot recognize [drunk_knight.GetHerHim]. Before I can even hope to respond, the knight draws his sword and challenges me: "I wonder, is it true you're as good as they say? Or perhaps you're just a coward in a fancy armor?"\n\nThe inn slowly goes silent and I can feel everybody's gaze upon me."
 agot_travel_events.0004.a:0 "If you're looking for a fight, you'll get one!"
 agot_travel_events.0004.a.success:0 "You beat the knight!"
 agot_travel_events.0004.a.failure:0 "The knight humiliates you."
 agot_travel_events.0004.b:0 "You want to prove yourself? Why don't you join me?"
 agot_travel_events.0004.b.success:0 "You persuade the knight!"
 agot_travel_events.0004.b.failure:0 "The knight mocks you."
 agot_travel_events.0004.c:0 "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]? You must be confusing me with someone..."
 agot_travel_events.0004.c.success:0 "You persuade the knight!"

 agot_travel_events.0005.desc:0 "Heading back to the inn from my stroll, I hear a loud thud; two men are throwing axes at each other! As I stop to observe their acrobactics, one of them spots me and calls out: "Care to join?"\n\n"The finger dance, we call it," explains [drunk_ironborn.GetFirstName]. "All you have to do, is catch the axe or leap over it without missing a step."\n\n"Oh, I bet a fine warrior like yourself can do it, no problem!" [drunk_ironborn.GetSheHe|l] adds laughingly."
 agot_travel_events.0005.a:0 "Sounds easy enough!"

 agot_travel_events.0005.c:0 "HAH! Axe throwing? You'd make a fine jester!"
 agot_travel_events.0005.c.success:0 "[drunk_ironborn.GetSheHe|U]... actually agrees..."

 agot_travel_events.0006.t:0 "Travel: Inn Troubles"
 agot_travel_events.0006.desc:0 "Once we get closer, the atmosphere grows uneasy. As I push the door, we are greeted by the sight of overturned tables and shattered glass. \n\nThe innkeeper welcomes us with a worried look on [innkeeper.GetHerHis] face: "Apologies travelers, I'm afraid you won't find the warm welcome you were looking for here. A group of bandits attacked the inn recently, we managed to fend them off, but I worry they will return soon with revenge."\n\n"We could use some capable hands, though.""
 agot_travel_events.0006.a:0 "We'll stay and help."

 agot_travel_events.0007.t:0 "At the Crossroads: The Ambush"
 agot_travel_events.0007.desc:0 "As we make our preparations, [fellow_knight.GetName] approaches me and suggests: "My [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip], sitting here and waiting while we could strike first would be a mistake. I've gathered a few men from the inn who know those lands better than anyone, let me go with them and let us flank the bandits before they reach us."
 agot_travel_events.0007.a:0 "I won't risk your lives, we shall face the enemy together."
 agot_travel_events.0007.a.tt:0 "You continue to wait until the bandits arrive."
 agot_travel_events.0007.b:0 "Very well, I shall await your return."
 agot_travel_events.0007.b.tt:0 "[fellow_knight.GetSheHe|U] might be right..."

 agot_travel_events.0008.a:0 "I will face the commander myself."
 agot_travel_events.0008.a.tt:0 "Begins a duel with [evil_bandit.GetFirstName]."

 agot_travel_events.0011.desc.intro:0 "A few days pass but only a handful drunkards pass by the inn, there's no sight of any bandits nearby. Were the innkeeper's worries unfounded? Or perhaps our presence scared them off? No way to tell...\n\n"

As I move further east, the walls come to dominate the skyline. The outer reaches eighty feet, and the inner reaching another twenty higher. They are dark and gray; the weathered stone speaks to the great age of the castle.\n\nThe East Gate stands open and welcoming, and inside you find the [winterfell_lord.GetFullName] waiting with salt and bread.
