 agot_events_rr_minor.0001.desc.a:0 "I rose from my tent to put my armor on early this morning; the air was thick with cold humidity cut to the bone. The morning dew clung to the rubies on my breastplate, making them glimmer ever brighter, and across the horizon was the camp of the would-be usurper, smoke billowing up from between the tents, his tent in the centre of the rabble. So close, yet so far.\n\nMore than just the cold in my bones, I feel him, his anger, and I know that we will meet in this battle, that sword and warhammer will clash. The thought made my stomach sink for just a second. One of my manservants asked if something was wrong with me, and I laughed for a second before regaining my composure. "No, my friend, nothing is wrong," I said.\n\n"Today is not the day I die.""

I know it in my heart that I'll track the proud prince down in the midst of the clamour and drive my hammer into his skull. It's all been building to this; every battle, every skirmish, every dead knight has brought us to this point. It's time to make Rhaegar bleed."

By the grace of the gods, the thunder and wind and hail stop long enough for all to hear it — the cries of a newborn baby.\n\nFor the first time in what has been days, Rhaella gives a relieved laugh, holding her newborn in her trembling arms, her sickly and blood-drained face smiling at her child. After all she has been through, this is a singular and brief reprieve from the horrors she has and is yet to face. "Stormborn," she coos quietly, her voice unsteady as the maester takes the child away to be seen to. \n\nAnother clap of thunder accompanies a pained groan from Rhaella — the babe has come, but she still bleeds at an alarming rate. As those at the docks accept the possibility that the fleet may be no more come morning, those at her bedside do the same for Rhaella.

All that survives of her once powerful dynasty are her two children. \n\nThough they may be small, they are nonetheless Targaryens, and as long as there is a memory of the Mad King, these children will be hunted — and there will surely be a grand reward waiting for whoever hands them over to the Iron Throne. \n\nWith time working against them, there's little option left for their survival than to smuggle the two out of Dragonstone and across the sea to the Free Cities. Perhaps there, time and space will allow those still loyal to regroup, or perhaps, at least, the children's names will fade away into obscurity as they grow. Perhaps they will know peace."
 agot_events_rr_minor.0006.desc.b:0 "I am unsure if it was the prayers of others, the fire of the dragon that burns in my blood, or just pure spite that saved me — but by some great miracle, the childbed has not become my deathbed. There is little rest to be had, however. Nowhere in Westeros will be safe for them, claim or not. \n\nI could flee across the sea with the children to the Free Cities, giving us time to recover and regroup. However, it is easier to hide two children than it is a former Queen — staying in Dragonstone may afford the children more discretion. If I can hold out, Dragonstone may prove politically beneficial to the children when they come of age. \n\nWhatever decision I make, it needs to be made soon. I have not a doubt in my mind that all of Westeros is after my children, seeking revenge, glory, or whatever coin the Iron Throne is offering up as some kind of sick bounty."

And when the Prince of Dragonstone chose not my daughter [daughter.GetName] as his Queen of Love and Beauty, but another, the seeds of this chaos were sown in the soil.\n\nNow my brother [brother.GetTitledFirstName] writes to me, and his words implore that I trust this Prince. That [rhaegar.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] plan will see the resplendent return of House [rhaegar.GetDynastyName] to her full glory.\n\nBut what of the future of House [ROOT.Char.GetDynastyName]? Our liege lords House [tully.GetDynastyName] have risen with the rebels, and [tully.GetTitledFirstName] is our goodbrother, his children of our blood.

They know my next voyage is like to be my final, and yet, not one is fit to follow me. I must suffer [balon.GetNamePossessive] incessant bemoaning of the loss of the Old Way, [victarian.GetNamePossessive] lack of composure, and [euron.GetNamePossessive] perverse ambitions — which I dare not detail, lest I will such degeneracy into fruition.\n\nMy [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMe', SCOPE.sC('piper'))] [piper.GetTitledFirstName] is my lone comfort. Young [robin.GetName] in her arms, the bridge between our two worlds, born of old and feeble seed. I quarried stone, but we walk on a rickety bridge in a storm.\n\nNow, as I stare my own mortality in the face, I see it plainly: #bold my legacy shall be ripped apart by own own whelps.#!
