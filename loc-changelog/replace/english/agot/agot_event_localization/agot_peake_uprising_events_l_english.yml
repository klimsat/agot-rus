Lands we had held since we banished the mermen from the Mander.\n\nNo more! We will reclaim all that has been lost since the ascension of [daeron.GetFirstName] the Falseborn, or we will fall in the attempt! We will not suffer on as an ailing dynasty.\n\nThough, if we were to prove our might, perhaps we could inspire the true monarch, [aenysclaimant.GetTitledFirstName] [aenysclaimant.GetHouse.GetName], to return from across the Narrow Sea..."

This time they are without any allies or even a Black Dragon to pledge themselves to.\n\n[peake.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] petty rebellion is nothing more than a chore; it will prove little challenge. [peake.GetHerHis|U] demands are unreasonable, I will not surrender the lands of Ashford and others to a house that has once again proved it cannot be trusted with the little might we have left it.\n\nStarpike is all that will remain to them when the day is done!"

[peake.GetFullName] has broken the king's peace with a rebellion that seems doomed at first glance.\n\n[maekar.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal] has not even called any of [maekar.GetHerHis] banners, relying solely on the men that [maekar.GetSheHe] and [egg.GetTitledFirstName] can muster. The Iron Throne may not have asked for my help, but they will not reject it.\n\nAfter all, it doesn't hurt to win favor with the house of the dragon.

Though [aenysclaimant.GetFirstName] [aenysclaimant.GetHouse.GetName] remains on the other side of the Narrow Sea, we must be diligent that this isn't the beginning of a fourth rebellion.\n\nI shall ride with all those who would help the throne restore peace and order, hopefully [peake.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can be brought down with little resistance."

On the other hand [reyne.GetTitledFirstName] seems eager to win glory and presses me to storm the castle, as to not keep our men trapped here for months as we wait for a few dozen men to stave.\n\nBoth arguments have their merits, but which is more convincing?"

So many have bled, but surely [peake.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] must die for this...
