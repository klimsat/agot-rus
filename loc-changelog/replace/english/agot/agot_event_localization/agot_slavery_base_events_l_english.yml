 agot_slavery.9001.desc:0 "I return from my most recent raid with many new souls in cages, anxiously awaiting their fate. A new life in my domain awaits them, their families and homes already have disappeared beyond the horizon.\n\nThere are many places in my domain that would benefit from extra sets of hands. But where should I send them?"

 agot_slavery.9003.t:0 "Freedmen Offer Their Services"
 agot_slavery.9003.desc:0 "My camp roars with life as soldiers celebrate their great victory, as fine a feast as could be prepared is laid out for them all to enjoy. One of my captains enters my tent, an expression of pride upon his face. "[ROOT.Char.GetTitledFirstName], a few of the new freedmen request an audience." I nod to him, awaiting the flurry of thanks the former slaves are sure to give.\n\n[freedman_1.GetFirstName] approaches with other freedmen at [freedman_1.GetHerHis] heels, they stop just before me and kneel. "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]! When the slavers stole us they destroyed our homes, butchered our families..." [freedman_1.GetFirstNameNoTooltip|U] glances to the familiar face of [freedman_2.GetFirstName] beside [freedman_1.GetHerHim], as if to draw from [freedman_2.GetHerHis] strength while holding back tears.\n\n"We thank you for freeing us from their grasp, but there is nothing for us to go back to. I humbly plead for you to take us into your service. We are all very skilled at our crafts, I am certain you can find a use for us!""
 agot_slavery.9003.a:0 "Of course I can find a place for you!"
 agot_slavery.9003.b:0 "You should rebuild your lives instead of seeking a new master."
