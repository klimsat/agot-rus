The air jabs its way into every gap in my furs and cloak, and the howling gales pummel my senses. I know the clouds above will carry with them snow to blind me as well. With the snows will also come wet, and with wet will come freezing. Shelter might save lives now."

The howling of the wind still haunts us inside, but the walls of the cave are thick, and they will shelter us from the worst of the cold.\n\nAs I step further into the cave, my eyes adjusting to the darkness I have no torches to dispel, I am surprised to find paintings waiting for me deeper within the cave. Figures of some folk who used this place for shelter before us."

The histories of a dozen clans and tribes line the walls, telling of their struggles and their triumphs. This place sheltered them all, as it shelters us now. These walls tell their stories, like I can hear their ghosts whispering to me through the distant sounds of the wind. As I examine the paintings in more detail, several start to call to me.\n\nWhich shall I focus on?”

I pause as it dawns on me that some of the bones still have meat attached, and glisten with crimson blood in our limited light. I start to instinctually reach for a weapon just as the hulking form of a thickly muscled bear steps into view. Blood trickles in steady drips from its mouth as it rears back and roars a challenge.”
