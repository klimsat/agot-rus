agot_birth_events.0003.desc:0 ""Just one more push, my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord], just one more! The baby is almost here!" A scream escapes my lips as I bear down for the last time. The pain is everywhere, it's too much, it's overwhelming — and then, it seems like it's over.... I did it.\n\n"Is my child alright?!" I barely recognize my own voice. "Is... Is it a [child.Custom('GirlBoy')]?"\n\nThe midwife does not answer me, does not even look at me. No, she only has her eyes for the unmoving bundle in her arms."
agot_birth_events.0003.a:0 "Isn't... Why isn't it breathing?! #EMP Do something!#!."

agot_birth_events.0004.t:0 "The Scale of Death"
agot_birth_events.0004.desc:0 "The midwife finally exits the birth chamber, her face is pale and she refuses to look me in the face.\n\n"I am so sorry my [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|U]. The child was born... misshapen." Her tone says it all. I enter the room where the stench of death hangs, and [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] holds to her breast a small, unmoving creature. Its scaled skin and vestigial wings would make it unrecognizable as human if not for the hair that [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] runs [mother.GetHerHim] fingers through.\n\nMy [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] has been born a monster."
agot_birth_events.0004.a:0 "Such a tragedy."

agot_birth_events.0005.t:0 "A Monster"
agot_birth_events.0005.desc:0 "The pain is #bold unbearable#!.\n\nBetween wrenching gasps and flashes hot as lightning ripping through my body, I swear I can hear a dragon's roar. Then... there's #italic nothing#!.\n\nSilence cradles the room, swaddling those present in a stillness unbroken by breath. At long last, [second_adult.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] pierces the quiet: "My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord|l], your babe... is here."\n\nI hadn't even noticed [second_adult.GetHerHim] handing me the child — if child is truly what [child.GetSheHe] is.\n\nIn my arms, tossing fitfully, #bold lies a#! #NEG monster#!."
agot_birth_events.0005.a:0 "My [child.Custom('GetDaughterSon')] is an abomination."

agot_birth_events.0006.t:0 "A Monster"
agot_birth_events.0006.desc:0 "The screams from the bedchamber grow increasingly frantic, ripping through the air like a dragon clawing its way from confinement. #italic Poor, sweet [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]... This baby may kill her...#!\n\nThe sudden silence jolts my senses. #italic It is done#!, I think, but I pause momentarily before entering — to compose myself, to steel myself for what may await me.\n\nThe carnage of the birthing leaves me aghast. My dear [mother.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], smock soaked in blood, holds the babe close to her chest. But her pained look frightens me as I approach to see my spawn.\n\nHere, before my eyes, is no mere child. Here is #bold a monster#!."
