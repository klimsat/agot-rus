 #Northern Old Gods

 old_gods_wnw_adj:0 "Старые боги зимы и лесов"
 old_gods_wnw_adherent:0 "Старобожник"
 old_gods_wnw_adherent_plural:0 "Старобожники"
 old_gods_wnw_desc:0 "Принятое после Договора, поклонение Старым богам сохранилось на Севере больше, чем в любой другой части Семи королевств. Поклонение Старым богам очень простое, гораздо более личное, чем Семибожие - в нём мало заповедей и нет священных писаний. Как почитать богов - личное дело каждого. Главные постулаты - святость чардрев, святость права гостя и святость клятв, принесенных перед сердцедревом."

 #River Old Gods
 old_gods_rnh:0 "Речно-старобожск"
 old_gods_rnh_adj:0 "Старые боги рек и холмов"
 old_gods_rnh_adherent:0 "Старобожник"
 old_gods_rnh_adherent_plural:0 "Старобожники"
 old_gods_rnh_desc:0 "Outside of the North, the next greatest bastion of the worship of the Old Gods is the Riverlands. Even before the revival, as men from the North settled here, key houses kept the worship. Their practice differs from their northern neighbors, melding with the Faith of the Seven to the south. In addition to the sacredness of the weirwoods and guest right, these people have adopted knighthoods — whose oaths are sworn not in a sept, but before the heart tree."

 old_gods_mnv_desc:0 "Though the Vale and Mountains of the Moon were the first to be conquered by the Andals and the first place where the Faith of the Seven took root in Westeros, there are still old and strong ties to the First Men and their beliefs. As such, the region has seen a return to the worship of the Old Gods, while still maintaining many of the traditions and rights that the people of the Vale knew as the Faithful."

 old_gods_rng_adherent_plural:0 "Старобожники"
 old_gods_rng_desc:0 "The Westerlands has long been a sacred place for the worship of the Old Gods. It was here that Corlos showed mercy upon the lion cubs and was rewarded by the Old Gods. The worship of the Old Gods has begun anew in the region, adopting some traits from the Faith of the Seven, such as knighthood, while also embracing the core tenets of the Pact."

 old_gods_fng_adherent_plural:0 "Старобожники"
 old_gods_fng_desc:0 "The Reach was the home of the Faith of the Seven for most of its history, yet it still maintains ties to the Old Gods. Tales of Garth Greenhand, the Living Throne of the Oakenseat, the Skinchangers by the Red Lake, and others, persist. These ties have been wholly embraced with the return of the worship of the Old Gods, although the influence of the Faith can still be seen in some of the tenets and traditions practiced in the Reach."
