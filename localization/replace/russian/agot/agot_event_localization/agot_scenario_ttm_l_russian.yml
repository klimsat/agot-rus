 agot_events_scenario_ttm.1.desc:0 "War greeted us home after our strategic withdrawal from the Stepstones, orchestrated by none other than the biggest thorn on Pentos' side, a Sealord of Braavos. A foolish mistake if there ever was one. Our thoroughly experienced veterans, hardened from their time down south, marched to halt their incursion into our lands. Where they expected to find nothing more than a rugged band of exhausted conscripts to sluggardly throw themselves on their blades, attritioned by years of strife with pirates and the likes, firmly stood the Prince's men.\n\nThey had thought us weak, but we held our ground and pushed the so-called self-proclaimed "liberators" out of Andalos. Now that the dust has settled, we once more stand as its uncontested hegemon."
