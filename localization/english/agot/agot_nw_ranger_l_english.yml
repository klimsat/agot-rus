 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.one.a:0 "Together, the wildling and I struck the beast down, our combined strength proving more than a match for its ferocity. As the beast collapsed, I felt a sharp sting from my own wound.\n\nThe wildling, in a rare moment of truce, knelt beside me and tended to the injury, muttering something in [main_figure.GetHerHis] tongue. It was not a permanent fix, but it was enough to get me through the day."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.one.b:0 "Side by side, we fought the beast. The wildling's spear and my blade cut the creature down, its heavy body falling lifeless before us. Exhausted, I realized blood was dripping from a wound I had not even noticed.\n\nThe wildling noticed before I could react and quickly bound the wound with a strip of cloth. [main_figure.GetSheHe|U] nodded once, and without another word, disappeared into the forest."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.one.c:0 "The wildling and I exchanged a quick glance before moving as one. Our combined efforts felled the beast with a swift, decisive blow.\n\nThe moment was tense, but before either of us could turn hostile, [main_figure.GetSheHe] gestured toward my injury. With surprising skill, [main_figure.GetSheHe] bandaged it quickly, [main_figure.GetHerHis] touch rough but effective. After [main_figure.GetSheHe] mended my wound, slipped away into the shadows."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.one.d:0 "With a nod of understanding, the wildling and I fought together, bringing the beast to the ground in a blur of steel and spear. The battle ended as quickly as it began, but the pain of my injury became more apparent.\n\nThe wildling stepped forward and, to my surprise, patched up the wound with a crude, yet effective, bandage. Without a word, [main_figure.GetSheHe] vanished into the trees."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.one.e:0 "The wildling did not hesitate as we fought together. Our weapons met the beast's hide, and it fell before us.\n\nMy own blood mixed with the snow, but the wildling, after sparing a glance at the dead beast, approached and mended my wound. [main_figure.GetHerHis|U] work was quick, but enough to keep me moving. Without further exchange, [main_figure.GetSheHe] disappeared into the wilderness."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.two.a:0 "With a fierce swing, I brought the beast low, my blade finding its mark. As the creature fell, I turned my attention to the wildling, but [main_figure.GetSheHe] had already vanished into the shadows.\n\nBreathing heavily, I took a moment to assess my injuries.\n\nThe wound was deep, but I managed to mend it myself, using the supplies I carried. The danger had passed, but the wildling was nowhere to be seen."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.two.b:0 "The beast lunged, but my blade met its charge. With a final blow, I felled it, and the wildling, seeing my strength, disappeared into the trees without a sound. After the chaos, I found myself clutching a wound from the battle. Carefully, I patched it up, wrapping it tightly with whatever scraps of cloth I had on hand. The wound was under control, but the wildling was long gone."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.two.c:0 "My sword cut through the beast, its snarl fading into the wind. The wildling, watching from the shadows, fled before I could confront [main_figure.GetHerHim].\n\nWith the threat gone, I tended to the wound the beast had left. It was a rough job, but I managed to stop the bleeding. The wildling's escape left me unsettled, but at least I had survived."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.two.d:0 "The creature fell before my blade, a swift end to the battle. The wildling, now wary of my strength, slipped away into the night before I could react.\n\nWith the beast dead, I finally had time to tend to the injury I had sustained. Binding the wound with what little I had, I braced myself for the journey back to the others."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.two.e:0 "With a powerful strike, I ended the beast's life, its body crashing to the ground in defeat. The wildling, clearly intimidated by my prowess, fled into the wilderness without looking back.\n\nAlone, I inspected the wound I had received. After a quick and painful patch-up, I was ready to head back, though the wildling's departure still left me uneasy."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.a:0 "While the beast and wildling fought each other, I slipped away quietly, leaving them to tear into one another in the chaos.\n\nMy wound throbbed as I ran, but I did not stop until I reached the others. Once I found my fellow rangers, they quickly helped me tend to the injury. The beast and wildling were left behind, their fates unknown."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.b:0 "As the beast and wildling turned on each other, I vanished into the trees, unnoticed by both as they fought savagely.\n\nBlood trickled from my side, but I pressed on until I found the safety of my camp. There, my comrades helped patch up the wound, ensuring I could recover from both the beast's attack and my narrow escape."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.c:0 "The wildling and beast clashed violently, allowing me to sneak away, unseen, as their fight consumed them both.\n\nBy the time I reached the other rangers, I was already losing blood, but they acted quickly to mend my injury. I had escaped the wildling and beast, but not without a reminder of the close call."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.d:0 "While the wildling and beast battled, I disappeared into the shadows. By the time they noticed, I was already gone. My wound slowed me down, but I managed to return to the others.\n\nThey helped bind the injury, ensuring I could continue the hunt, though the encounter still haunted my thoughts."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1104.desc.three.e:0 "With the wildling distracted by the beast, I took my chance to slip away, leaving the two locked in a brutal fight. I stumbled upon my comrades soon after, my wound bleeding heavily.\n\nThey worked quickly to patch me up, and though I had survived, the wildling and beast were left behind, their fate a mystery."

 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.one.b:0 "My attempt to show gratitude to the wildling backfired. [main_figure.GetSheHe|U] must have thought I was trying to trick [main_figure.GetHerHim], because instead of fighting alongside me, [main_figure.GetSheHe] turned on me. I fled, wounded, leaving both the wildling and beast behind."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.one.c:0 "I tried to convince the wildling to help, but [main_figure.GetHerHis] eyes darkened with suspicion. The moment shattered, and the beast attacked. I managed to escape, but my wound bled heavily, and the wildling disappeared into the forest."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.one.d:0 "My gesture of peace was misread. The wildling saw my movements as a threat, and I suddenly found myself defending against both [main_figure.GetHerHim] and the beast. Barely escaping with my life, I stumbled back, injured."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.one.e:0 "I reached out to the wildling, trying to thank [main_figure.GetHerHim] for [main_figure.GetHerHis] help, but [main_figure.GetSheHe] misunderstood me. Instead of helping me finish the beast, [main_figure.GetSheHe] lunged at me. I ran, wounded, with the wildling and beast left to fight in the distance."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.two.a:0 "I raised my weapon, determined to defeat both the wildling and the beast, but they overwhelmed me. I fought hard, but my strength failed. Bloodied, I barely managed to escape with my life."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.two.b:0 "The beast was fierce, and though I fought valiantly, my body betrayed me. Between the wildling's swift attacks and the beast's relentless assault, I was forced to flee, injured and defeated."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.two.c:0 "I swung my blade, intending to take them both down. But the wildling moved faster than I expected, and the beast struck with ferocious strength. My vision blurred as I stumbled away, barely alive."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.two.d:0 "I thought I could overpower them both, but the wildling was skilled, and the beast was relentless. My wounds deepened as I realized I could not win. I fled, my pride and body both wounded."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.two.e:0 "My strength was not enough. The beast and wildling worked together in a deadly dance of claws and blades. I had no choice but to run, bleeding and barely holding on."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.three.a:0 "I tried to sow discord between the wildling and the beast, but they saw through my deception. Both turned on me, and I fled, wounded and breathless, barely escaping their wrath."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.three.b:0 "My attempt to trick them into fighting each other failed miserably. The wildling caught on, and the beast turned its attention to me. I ran, my wound slowing me down as I struggled to survive."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.three.c:0 "I thought I could outwit them, but the wildling was too clever. Instead of turning on each other, both the beast and wildling lunged at me. I escaped, but not without suffering a serious injury."
 agot_nw_ranger_events.1105.desc.three.d:0 "My plan to set them against each other crumbled when the wildling realized my trick. The beast came after me, and I fled into the wilderness, wounded and humiliated."
