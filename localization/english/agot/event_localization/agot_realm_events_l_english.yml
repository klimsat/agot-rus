Our loving frolic is paused by the emergence of two grassy knolls looming into view on the horizon, drawing a titter from us both. \n\nThis particular tract of land is popularly known as [teats.GetName], for its not-so-subtle resemblance to a woman's bodice. Though tilting your head suddenly they remind you of a pair that you are intimately familiar with.\n\n"My [ROOT.Char.GetLadyLord]," [lover.GetName] speaks [lover.Custom('quirk_pos_adverb')], snapping you from your reverie and she responds with a smile. "Something on your mind?" You manage to keep your eyes from drifting to the hills writ small as an idea begins to form..."

I clench my fists as another kneels and grovels his obsequious request. What an enormous waste of my valuable time.\n\nSuddenly a white heat streaks across my arm, and I recoil in pain. The sleeve of my tunic sours a dark carmine as blood soaks through. The torn flap of fabric still impaled on the iron fang upon which I have torn my arm.\n\n"Maester, fetch the maester!" a voice calls.\n"[ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] has been bitten by the throne!" calls another.\n"[ROOT.Char.GetSheHe|U] has been rebuked!"\n#EMP "[ROOT.Char.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is no true [ROOT.Char.GetTitleAsNameNoTooltip|l]!"#!"
