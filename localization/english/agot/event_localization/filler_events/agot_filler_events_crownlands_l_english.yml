 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.desc:0 "I walk across the eponymous material of Dragonstone castle's gate, crossing onto the sand-mixed dirt of the island. The sun is shining across the water, casting its warming rays over the imposing form of the Dragonmont. As eerie as the island is, it can be quite beautiful in its own way.\n\nFor the first time in a long time, there are no pressing matters to attend to. No greedy petitioners, no scheming courtiers, no angry lords. Just me and the island. What shall I do today?"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.a_normal:0 "I'll spend time in the gardens."
 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.a_aegon:0 "Let's have a look at Aegon's Garden."
 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.b:0 "Let's explore the caves of the Dragonmont!"

 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.b_tt_2:0 "You have a chance to find something special"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0001.c:0 "I'll just relax for the day."

 agot_filler_crownlands.0002.t:0 "A Day on Dragonstone: Sharp Rocks"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0002.desc:0 "The sharp rocks of Dragonstone's coast are treacherous; the waves crash against them with a spray that coats the already slick black stone. Yet the light cast into the caves is beautiful, the shadows dancing across the surface of the obsidian. I breathe in the salty air, feeling the wind whip around me. Glorious.\n\nAs I walk back to the castle, however, I feel my foot slip! I fall, my hand scraping against the sharp rocks. It's not a deep cut, but it has ruined my relaxation. I should have been more careful."
 agot_filler_crownlands.0002.a:0 "Ow!"

 agot_filler_crownlands.0003.t:0 "A Day on Dragonstone: Beautiful Caves"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0003.desc:0 "The caves of Dragonstone are beautiful, the light cast into them from the outside world creating a beautiful dance of shadows across the obsidian walls. As I head deeper into the caves, I find a small alcove, the light shining down through a hole in the ceiling, cascading light across the room and into a further chamber.\n\nA sense of awe fills me as I step through — the room is but a small outlook over a glorious underground cavern! The light shines down from the hole in the ceiling, casting a beautiful light that dances across all the mystically beautiful formations of the cave. While too deep to do anything more significant with, it's truly a sight to behold!"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0003.a:0 "How glorious!"

 agot_filler_crownlands.0004.t:0 "A Day on Dragonstone: Gifts from the Past"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0004.desc:0 "I walk high up on the cliffs of Dragonstone, the sound of waves crashing against the rocks below mixing with the slow rumble of the volcano in my ears. As I walk, I find a small opening — the perfect place for my cave exploration to begin.\n\nI climb over a crest of rock, guided by the light cascading over the rocks. Several passages lead off from the main chamber, but the light streaks through a single vein of obsidian, as though guiding me. I follow it, and where it leads me, I cannot believe.\n\nAn egg rests in the center of the room, the light ending just above it! As soon as I touch it, however, the passage of time makes itself known, and the light begins to fade. I barely have enough time to grab the egg and rush out of the cave before the light would fade completely, locking me in darkness.\n\nWith heavy breaths of exertion, I make it out of the cave, the egg in my hands!"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0004.a:0 "That was close, but well worth it!"
 agot_filler_crownlands.0004.tt:0 "You gained a Dragon Egg [artifact|E]"
