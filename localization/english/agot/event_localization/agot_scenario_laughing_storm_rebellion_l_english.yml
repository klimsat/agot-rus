The world around me fades, and I am no longer Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, but a lone figure in a strange, cold landscape. Before me, on a hill, stands a tree, vast and ancient, its pale bark shining like bone in the moonlight. Beneath it, a cave yawns like a waiting mouth.\n\nI feel the pull of it, calling me closer. I step forward, but the ground beneath my feet begins to freeze, creeping up with icy fingers, threatening to hold me in place. I struggle forward, but the frost grows stronger.\n\nJust before I can reach the tree, the cold overtakes me, and I wake in a start, the vision still vivid in my mind."

The world is a barren, snow-covered wasteland, with a wind that cuts through my cloak like a knife. In the distance, I see it: a wolf, larger than any I have ever seen, its fur dark as the night sky, blending into the shadows of the landscape. Its eyes, red, like blood against the pale snow, glow with a fierce, unsettling light. The wolf watches me with those burning eyes, its gaze piercing through the cold, as if it knows something I do not.\n\nI try to step closer, but with each stride, the wolf retreats into the mist, always just beyond my reach. The red eyes are the last thing I see before it vanishes into the snow.\n\nI wake with a start, my heart pounding, the image of the dark wolf burned into my mind."

From the distance, a crow swoops down, its black wings cutting through the air with silent precision. As it draws closer, something strange catches my eye, this is no ordinary crow. A third eye, perched in the center of its forehead, stares at me, unblinking and all-knowing. The crow circles above, its gaze unnerving, as though it sees far more than I can comprehend.\n\nIt caws once, its cry echoing across the empty landscape, and I feel as though I am being watched by something far beyond the bird itself.\n\nI wake, my heart heavy with the weight of its gaze, and the image of the three-eyed crow lingering in the darkness of my thoughts."

From the corner of my eye, I spot a boy, small and nimble, scaling the walls with ease, his hands and feet finding impossible holds in the stone. He moves like a shadow, fearless and swift, climbing higher and higher. The child does not look back, as though he knows no fear of falling.\n\nI call out to him, but my voice is swallowed by the wind. He continues his ascent, higher than any mortal should go, until he disappears into the mist at the top of the tower. \n\nI wake with the image of the child still fresh in my mind, his impossible climb lingering in the back of my thoughts."

The great tree still stands upon the hill, towering over the landscape with its pale bark, its branches stretching toward the sky like twisted fingers. The cave below it gapes wide, darker than I remember, as if it waits for something, or someone. The frost beneath my feet returns, creeping upward, but this time the cold no longer halts my steps.\n\nI move forward, each step slower, heavier, but the tree's call is clearer now, more urgent. As I near the base of the hill, the winds howl, and the ground trembles beneath me. The tree's branches sway as though alive, beckoning me closer still.\n\nI wake suddenly, the chill of the dream still lingering in the air, the pull of the tree stronger than ever."

The wind bites at my skin, but it is not the cold that unnerves me, it is the eyes watching me from the distance. The dark wolf is there again, larger than before, its fur blending with the shadows against the snow. Its red eyes gleam in the darkness, watching, waiting.\n\nThis time, it does not retreat as I approach. Instead, it stands its ground, unblinking, its gaze fixed on me. I step forward, and the wolf lets out a low growl, a sound that rumbles through the frozen air. It feels as though it is trying to communicate, to warn me, or perhaps test me. I move closer, but the wolf bares its teeth, its red eyes glowing brighter. I freeze in place, torn between advancing and retreating.\n\nThe moment stretches, and then I wake, the wolf's gaze still burning in my mind."

This time, the crow appears almost immediately, swooping down from the dark sky with silent wings. Its three eyes glow in the dim light, their gaze more intense, more piercing than before. The third eye, in particular, seems to stare into my very soul, as though seeing not just what I am, but what I could be.\n\nThe crow lands on a twisted branch nearby, watching me in silence. I feel its presence, its power, a force beyond my understanding. It caws once, louder than before, and for a moment, the entire world trembles at its sound. The crow watches me still, as though waiting for me to understand something I cannot yet grasp.\n\nI wake in the darkness, the crow's unblinking eyes lingering in my mind, as if they had followed me into the waking world."

This time, I step closer, moving toward the base of the tower, the stones cold beneath my feet. As I approach, the sky above darkens, and a red comet streaks across it like a flaming sword. Its fiery tail illuminates the boy's climb, casting long, eerie shadows. I pause, frozen by the comet's brilliance, feeling the weight of something greater stirring in the air.\n\nWhen I look back to the boy, he is gone. In his place, a single black crow perches on the wall where he once was.

I try to walk toward it, but with each step, the darkness grows thicker, swallowing the light.\n\nShadows shift and twist in the snow, and I realize that something is moving within them, something ancient, something evil.

At first, they appear as shadows, but as they draw nearer, I see them clearly.\n\nThese are not men, they are corpses. Faces frozen in death, eyes hollow, skin gray and rotting, but they move as though life still courses through their veins. The dead have risen, walking toward me with an eerie silence. Their eyes seem to see nothing and everything all at once. I try to speak, to call out, but my voice fails. Suddenly, one of the dead turns its head, fixing its lifeless gaze on me.\n\nI wake in a cold sweat, the image of those walking corpses lingering in my mind."

But when I returned with my group, the children were gone, vanished as though they had never been there at all. The others looked at me with doubt, and I began to question whether I had imagined it. But the feeling of their presence still lingers, as if they are watching from the shadows."

 agot_laughing_storm_rebellion.0465.desc:0 "The chill wind of the North sweeps across Castle Black, a constant reminder of the harsh duty I now bear. As I stare out across the Wall, my thoughts drift unbidden to a time long past, to faces that remain etched in my mind like scars upon the soul. Two brothers loom most clearly in my memories: one, noble and proud, who I once loved before ambition tore him from me; the other, a shadowed figure of vengeance and bitterness, his enmity ever as cold as the ice beneath my feet.\n\nThese thoughts gnaw at me, resurfacing despite the years that have passed. The bonds of blood and betrayal have shaped me into the man I am now, a man standing sentinel at the edge of the world. It is a duty that offers neither solace nor escape from the echoes of the past. Perhaps it is here, amidst the endless snow and ancient trees, that I am meant to find peace — or to carry those ghosts with me until the end."

 agot_laughing_storm_rebellion.0466.desc:0 "Sleep pulls me into yet another vision, one that burns as bright as the sun. A figure stands before me, surrounded by flames, their form distorted by the searing heat as the fire consumes them. The heat is unbearable, the flames rising higher, swallowing the figure whole.\n\nI try to reach them, but the fire forces me back. Just as they disappear into the inferno, I look up and see the night sky itself ablaze, as though the stars are burning, the heavens igniting with fire. The ground trembles beneath me, and from the heart of the flames, a shadow stirs. A dragon, great and terrible, steps from the fire, its scales gleaming like molten steel. Its eyes lock onto mine, and I can feel its presence, ancient and powerful.\n\nI wake in a cold sweat, the image of the dragon and the figure burned into my mind, their fates intertwined with the fiery sky above."

 agot_laughing_storm_rebellion.0467.desc:0 "As sleep overtakes me, I am pulled into a vision of fire and destruction. A great city stretches before me, but something is terribly wrong. The flames consuming it are not ordinary fire, but a strange, unnatural green, glowing with an eerie and malevolent light that twists the very air around it. Wildfire.\n\nThe buildings crackle and hiss as the green flames devour their edges, melting stone and wood into grotesque shapes. The fire seems alive, hungry, not only consuming the city's structures but the very ground beneath it.\n\nThe smell of burning stone and ash fills the air, and I watch, helpless, as the heart of the city is reduced to ruin. I wake suddenly, the image of the burning city etched into my thoughts, the green wildfire still burning in my mind."

 agot_laughing_storm_rebellion.0468.desc:0 "As I stand at the top of the Wall, the frozen wastes stretching endlessly before me, the wind whispers through the icy air like a voice from long ago. The cold bites at my skin, but the weight of the past chills me more. My thoughts turn to tales of old, Targaryens who saw visions of the future, dreams haunted by what was to come.\n\nLong before the Conquest, dragons were said to see beyond the present, their dreams both a blessing and a curse. Prophecies of fire, blood, and doom, glimpsed in flickering flames, came at a cost — dragging their dreamers into madness or despair.\n\nAs I gaze into the distance, the snow-covered world seems to shift. The weight of those dreams bears down on me. Do I share this legacy? Do shadows of the future call to me, showing what may come at a terrible price? The Wall offers no answers, only cold and silence."

Within my chambers, the flickering flame of a lone candle casts shadows across the stone walls. I sit in silence, wrapped in the black cloak of the Night's Watch. It is nights like this when memories of old betrayals creep into my mind.\n\nMy eye wanders to the far corner, where a raven perches silently, watching. I murmur to myself, recalling a long-past conversation: #italic "Treason is no less vile because the traitor proves a craven."#! Butterwell had learned that lesson, and now these brothers, too, walk carefully in my shadow.\n\nThe night deepens, the cold pressing against the walls of Castle Black. Somewhere out there, in the darkness, secrets stir, but for now, all is still. I remain vigilant, my watch unending."
