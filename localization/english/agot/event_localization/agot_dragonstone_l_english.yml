 agot_dragonstone.0002.desc:0 "Since the time of Aenys I, Dragonstone has been the seat of the heir of the Iron Throne. Now that [heir.GetFirstName] is of an age to manage Dragonstone on [heir.GetHerHis] own, it is time for me to either grant [heir.GetHerHim] the title of [heir.Custom('GetPrincessPrince')] of Dragonstone in recognition of [heir.GetHerHis] position in the realm, or to hold on to the title myself for future uses."
 agot_dragonstone.0002.a:0 "The tradition must be upheld; I shall grant [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] Dragonstone."
 agot_dragonstone.0002.b:0 "The tradition has passed its time; I shall keep Dragonstone for myself."

 agot_dragonstone.0003.desc:0 "Now that I sit upon the Iron Throne it is time my heir, [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], take [heir.GetHerHis] place as [heir.Custom('GetPrincessPrince')] of Dragonstone, or I can keep the traditional seat of the Conqueror for myself as a royal refuge."
 agot_dragonstone.0003.a:0 "The tradition must be upheld; I shall grant [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] Dragonstone."

 agot_dragonstone.0007.desc:0 "With the death of [deceased_heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is now rightfully the [heir.Custom('GetPrincessPrince')] of Dragonstone. I'm not sure I'm ready to name another heir so soon after the death of my [ROOT.Char.Custom2('RelationToMeShort', deceased_heir)]. Maybe I should just keep [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] close for now..."
 agot_dragonstone.0007.a:0 "The tradition must be upheld; I shall grant [heir.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] Dragonstone."

 agot_dragonstone.0008.desc:0 "By custom and by right, the heir to the Iron Throne must first temper [heir.GetHerHis] will upon Dragonstone. Today, that mantle passes to [heir.GetFirstName], who now rules as [heir.Custom('GetPrincessPrince')] of Dragonstone, as those before [heir.GetHerHim] have done. A taste of command, a glimpse of what awaits — one day, when my time has run its course, [heir.GetSheHe] shall inherit more than this ancient seat; [heir.GetSheHe] shall inherit the realm itself.\n\nThe eyes of the court turn toward [heir.GetHerHim] now, watching, weighing. Will [heir.GetSheHe] prove [heir.GetHerselfHimself] worthy of the burden [heir.GetSheHe] will one day bear?"
 agot_dragonstone.0008.a:0 "[heir.GetHerHis|U] path is set — time will tell the rest."
 agot_dragonstone.0008.b:0 "I wonder what kind of ruler [heir.GetSheHe] will become."
