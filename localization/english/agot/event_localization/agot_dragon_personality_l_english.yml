 agot_dragon_personality.0001.t:0 "A Friendly Monster"
 agot_dragon_personality.0001.desc:0 "I toss a slab of meat towards [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] and [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] catches it in mid-air. As I step back though, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] stops devouring it and instead approaches, head moving towards my bloody hand. At first, I think [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] wants more food, but instead [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] nuzzle my hand! [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is becoming quite sociable, and seems comfortable around anything [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')].\n\nThough such a nature may serve well in these walls, I do wonder how this will affect [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] combat abilities."
 agot_dragon_personality.0001.a:0 "Approachable; a good trait to have!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0001.b:0 "A dragon is for fighting! Not nuzzling!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0001.c:0 "Affection is not enough, submission is needed!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0002.t:0 "An Aggressive Beast"
 agot_dragon_personality.0002.desc:0 "It has become difficult not to notice [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessive] growing aggression. [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] is becoming more and more difficult to control [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], lashing out at even minor inconveniences. Some of my servants are now even refusing to assist at feeding time, lest they be the unfortunate victim of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] growing wrath.\n\nThough a fearsome beast has its benefits, I do wonder if this is the best path for [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_dragon_personality.0002.a:0 "You cannot change the beast within."
 agot_dragon_personality.0002.b:0 "Serene it must be, by nature or by whip."
 agot_dragon_personality.0002.c:0 "This should be encouraged! Feed it live meat next time!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0003.t:0 "A Scared Terror"
 agot_dragon_personality.0003.desc:0 "Feeding time has become a delicate affair with [growing_dragon.GetFirstName], revealing a temperament as elusive as the morning mist. Today, when the handlers brought in a sheep, its bleating seemed to unsettle the young wyrm. Rather than approaching with the confidence of its kin, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] hung back, talons clicking apprehensively against stone.\n\nEach time the sheep moved, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] shifted, as if the mere rustling of wool were a threat to be evaluated. It was only with gentle coaxing that [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] edged closer, flaring nostrils a sign of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] lingering unease. With a swift, almost reluctant snap, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] finally took [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] meal. It seems this creature of legend and might may possess the heart of a sparrow."
 agot_dragon_personality.0003.a:0 "How queer! A skittish dragon!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0003.b:0 "A dragon should be bold! Get the fighting dogs!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0003.c:0 "If we give it some space, maybe it will relax?"

 agot_dragon_personality.0004.t:0 "A Terrifying Calamity"
 agot_dragon_personality.0004.desc:0 "In order to preserve [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] natural instincts, I sometimes allow live prey to be hunted by [growing_dragon.GetFirstName]. Today I have locked a deer in with [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], and [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has taken to the hunt with a ferocity I have not seen before, shredding flesh eagerly with powerful jaws.\n\nMore than that though, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] seems to have left the creature still alive! Rather than burning the meat before eating as before, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] looks to be savoring the blood and viscera in its maw. Almost as though [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] is... reveling in the bleating of the dying animal."
 agot_dragon_personality.0004.a:0 "A truly horrifying monster but...my monster."
 agot_dragon_personality.0004.b:0 "This is unseemly! Beat [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] if [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] does it again!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0004.c:0 "This is a good sign! [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] fights for what [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] wants!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0005.t:0 "A Gentle Giant"
 agot_dragon_personality.0005.desc:0 "The concern was less the wall repairs and more the step beforehand. Ushering a dragon like [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] elsewhere, even temporarily, is not a task to be approached lightly.\n\nAs the craftsmen approached, I expected [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] to greet them with a territorial snarl. However, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] simply lifted [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] gaze, eyes shimmering with an intelligence that transcended beastly instinct. With a dignified stretch of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] wings [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] ambled forth, each step deliberate and unhurried, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] tail sweeping gently behind. [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U] settled in a new location with a tranquility that eased the tension of the moment.\n\nThe workers began their toil, casting glances of gratitude and respect towards the dragon who watched them with a placid curiosity."
 agot_dragon_personality.0005.a:0 "Convenient! Perhaps raising dragons is not so hard after all."
 agot_dragon_personality.0005.b:0 "This is a travesty! How ever will our enemies fear us?"
 agot_dragon_personality.0005.c:0 "Perhaps we can introduce [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to some other animals?"

 agot_dragon_personality.0006.t:0 "A Defiant Lizard"
 agot_dragon_personality.0006.desc:0 ""We are trying but I'm afraid [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] is simply not cooperating." The handler's voice is strained as he speaks, and I can hear the tension in his tone as he wrestles with the chain that binds [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip], trying to once again lock [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to the wall.\n\nThough [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was never a particularly obedient creature, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has become increasingly difficult to control. While a dragon with a will of its own is a fearsome thing, I do wonder if this is the best path for [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_dragon_personality.0006.a:0 "I'd rather have a dragon with a will of its own than a sheep."
 agot_dragon_personality.0006.b:0 "A dragon must be controlled! [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] will starve until [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] obeys!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0006.c:0 "Due deference #bold should #!be shown to such majesty!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0007.t:0 "A Humble Tyrant"
 agot_dragon_personality.0007.desc:0 "Frustrating news from [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessive] feeders today — [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has begun to refuse to eat so long as anyone else is in the room with [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')]. Apparently, if anyone else is present, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] will simply stare at them. This remained until one of the feeders decided to eat his own lunch at the same time, and as it turns out, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was waiting for the feeder to eat first!\n\n[growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has clearly developed a supportive streak; the question is do I let this continue?"
 agot_dragon_personality.0007.a:0 "Oh this will make training easy!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0007.b:0 "A dragon should know their place above the rabble!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0007.c:0 "Grant extra food for [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] good nature."

 agot_dragon_personality.0008.t:0 "A Commanding Presence"
 agot_dragon_personality.0008.desc:0 "Frustrating news from [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessive] feeders today — [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has begun to demand food, rather than waiting for it to be given. Adding onto the frustration, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] has even begun to growl at the servants who do not #EMP bow#! when they approach [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')].\n\n[growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has clearly developed an arrogant streak; the question is if I will let this continue?"
 agot_dragon_personality.0008.a:0 "A dragon is to be respected after all."

 agot_dragon_personality.0009.t:0 "A Patient Drake"
 agot_dragon_personality.0009.desc:0 "As I walk through my halls I hear an argument coming from a side room, stopping just in time to catch one of my servants slapping another! Before I can object though, he notices me and explains "I'm sorry you had to see that. This fool here forgot to feed [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] today. Apparently, the beast is so quiet as to be forgotten!"\n\nI had heard that [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] was hard to notice, but had not expected it to this extent! Should I intervene, or is this just part of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] nature?"
 agot_dragon_personality.0009.a:0 "A dragon shouldn't be impulsive; this will make training easy!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0009.b:0 "Patience is weakness! I'll make sure [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] learns!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0009.c:0 "Eat with it next time, I'm sure you'll notice it then!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0010.t:0 "A Demanding Wyrmling"
 agot_dragon_personality.0010.desc:0 "That noise just will not stop! I have been hearing it for the past hour, and it is driving me mad! I finally decide to investigate, and find [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] protesting at one of my servants.\n\n"I am sorry!" he exclaims "We've already fed [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] yet still [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] complains! [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')|U]'s scratching at the bars when the scent wafts through!".\n\nIt seems that [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has become impatient as [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] ages, and now I have to deal with it."
 agot_dragon_personality.0010.a:0 "Of course it's demanding, just don't listen."
 agot_dragon_personality.0010.b:0 "Don't feed it this time, then double the food next time."
 agot_dragon_personality.0010.c:0 "Move [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to a quieter location then! Whatever shuts [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] up!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0011.desc:0 "In order to preserve [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] natural instincts, I sometimes allow live prey to be hunted by [growing_dragon.GetFirstName]. Today I had locked a deer in with [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')], but rather than attacking, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] instead approached the creature and is now nuzzling it!\n\nAfter a few minutes the deer seems to have even become comfortable, and lies down! [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] appears to be enjoying the company, and is even allowing the deer to lick [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] face!\n\nThough such a nature may serve well in these walls, I do wonder how this will affect [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] combat abilities."
 agot_dragon_personality.0011.a:0 "Awwww! So cute!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0011.b:0 "No, you kill it, like #EMP this!#!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0012.desc:0 "I toss another slab of meat and it the ground with a neat #italic slooop #!. Though [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessive] eyes track the meat as it flies, only once I step back does [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] begins to devour it. I step forward to throw another but I receive a hiss of complaint in response.\n\nIt seems that [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is becoming quite territorial, and is uncomfortable around anything [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] is not currently eating.\n\nThough such a nature may serve well in the wild, I wonder how this will affect [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] life with humans."
 agot_dragon_personality.0012.a:0 "It is a good thing to be wary."
 agot_dragon_personality.0012.b:0 "A dragon must be able to trust its rider."
 agot_dragon_personality.0012.c:0 "Give it more to eat then, and [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] will be more comfortable!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0013.t:0 "A Clever Eater"
 agot_dragon_personality.0013.desc:0 "During the day's routine feeding, a curious scene unfolded with [growing_dragon.GetFirstName]. I observed as the handlers brought forward a boar. Instead of striking with voracity, [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] displayed a striking level of forbearance.\n\n[growing_dragon.GetSheHe|U] circled the boar, nostrils flaring and eyes locked, yet [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] mighty jaws did not snap shut. With a nudge of [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] snout, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] urged the boar to its feet, escorting it to some growing moss in the corner. There, [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonSheHe')] watched as the boar consumed the loose plants. Only once the boar had its fill did [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] partake in [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] own meal, roasting the now-filled boar.\n\nSuch discipline in [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHis')] dining spoke volumes of [growing_dragon.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]'s nature, a dragon of rather majestic restraint."
 agot_dragon_personality.0013.a:0 "Well, that's interesting. We'll have to watch this one."
 agot_dragon_personality.0013.b:0 "A dragon should be voracious! We'll force [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to eat!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0013.c:0 "Very good! Reward [growing_dragon.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] patience!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0014.t:0 "A Bottomless Pit"
 agot_dragon_personality.0014.desc:0 "I'm reviewing the financial reports I'd received when I notice one particularly large item. Dragon food, twice again the number it was this time last year. After enquiring with my staff, I learn that [growing_dragon.GetFirstName] has been eating more and more, violently complaining when it is not given as much as it wants. Under threat, the handlers have simply been giving it whatever it wanted!\n\nWhile a dragon so food-motivated is quite pliable, this is getting out of hand. Perhaps this is just part of raising a growing dragon?"
 agot_dragon_personality.0014.a:0 "A dragon should be well fed, it will make training easy!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0014.b:0 "Fitness, not food! We'll force [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] to exercise!"
 agot_dragon_personality.0014.c:0 "Make [growing_dragon.Custom('GetDragonHerHim')] work for it at least!"

 agot_dragon_personality.0015.t:0 "A Cannibal Instinct"
