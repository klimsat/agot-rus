 agot_scenario_trp.0001.t:0 "The Rogue Prince's War"
 agot_scenario_trp.0001.desc:0 "I step off the back of [current_dragon.GetName], removing my helm to survey the war camp before me. Banners of Targaryen and Velaryon flutter in the wind, soldiers preparing for our next offensive already. The island of [ROOT.Char.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] fell easily enough, but the rest of Stepstones shall not be so simple.\n\nThough I may have been denied my birthright as Prince of Dragonstone, I shall not let my brother relegate me to obscurity. I shall conquer the Stepstones, and prove that this second son is the true heir of House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName]!"

 agot_scenario_trp.0002.desc_crabfeeder:0 "Victory! The first of these pretender admirals has been defeated, and the heart of the Stepstones are ours! It seems, however, that the Triarchy has caught wind of our actions, and has joined [crabfeeder.GetFirstNameNicknamedPossessive] efforts to stop us.\n\nFurther, it appears they have given their assent to his primacy over his co-admirals, and their forces rally united under his banner.\n\nUnited, divided, hundreds of ships or thousands, I shall not let them stop me! All will learn the true meaning of #italic Fire and Blood!#!"

 agot_scenario_trp.0003.desc:0 "The Stepstones are mine! The Triarchy's fleet is in ruins, and their armies scattered to the winds.\n\nI have been crowned King of the Stepstones and the Narrow Sea, and the world now knows that at least one Targaryen still embodies his house's destiny!\n\nThough the Triarchy has been pushed back to the edge of these Isles, it remains to be seen if they will accept their defeat, or if they will try to reclaim their lost lands.\n\nThough news of their next move will surely come soon, there is a small window to breathe, and in the meantime, I am triumphant!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0003.a:0 "Bow before your King!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0003.a.tt:0 "The Triarchy will soon decide whether to accept their defeat, or to try to reclaim their lost lands"

 agot_scenario_trp.0004.t:0 "Snakes from the Desert"
 agot_scenario_trp.0004.desc:0 "It seems that the Dornish are not content to let a second Targaryen realm border theirs. I have received word that they have sent their own army to the Stepstones, and have entreated the Triarchy to once again try to unseat me!\n\nThough still recovering from our last war, these upjumped merchants may prove difficult to defeat alongside their new desert rat friends. Perhaps I should simply return to the Red Keep, content in my glory, or perhaps I should show the world that the Targaryens keep what they take!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0004.a:0 "Dornish or no, our enemies will burn!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0004.b:0 "All this for a pile of rocks in the sea?"

 agot_scenario_trp.0005.t:0 "Unchallenged Dragonlord of the Sea"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.desc:0 "The Triarchy has been forced to accept my rule and has firmly been confined back to Essos. I have proven that the Stepstones are mine, and I shall not let them go easily!\n\nMy realm strong and united under my rule, I now face a choice. To the east lies my longtime foe, licking their wounds. I could strike while they are weak, and bring this empire under #italic my #!rule. To the west, "
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.desc.west_brother:0 "my brother sits on the Iron Throne. Though I love him, I know that he is no true dragon. Do I dare to challenge him?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.desc.west_niece:0 "my niece sits on the Iron Throne. But a girl, she is no true heir to the Targaryen legacy. Yet I love her still."
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.desc.west_other:0 "some false heir sits on the Iron Throne, their achievements paling in comparison to my own."
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.desc.end:0 "I could also swear fealty to the throne. Surely adding a new kingdom to the Seven warrants a prize?\n\nFinally I could also simply rule my realm, content in my glory. The choice is mine."
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.a:0 "I shall conquer the Triarchy!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.b:0 "Enough pretending. The Iron Throne should be mine!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.c:0 "The Stepstones shall be added to the Seven Kingdoms!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.c.tt:0 "You may be granted additional boons for your great service to the realm"

 agot_scenario_trp.0005.d.tt:0 "You will remain independent, and continue to rule the Stepstones"
 agot_scenario_trp.0005.e:0 "I grow tired of this realm of rock. I shall return to the Red Keep."

 agot_scenario_trp.0006.t:0 "A Sea Snake's Invitation"
 agot_scenario_trp.0006.desc:0 "My onetime war ally and friend, [corlys.GetTitledFirstName], has sent me an invitation to Driftmark! Though I have been before, and it has not even been so long since I saw Corlys last, there is a hint of... opportunity in his words. Corlys was always one for the grand gesture, and I cannot help but wonder what he has in mind.\n\nShould I accept this invitation, or should I remain here?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0006.a:0 "Let's see what slithering the Sea Snake has in mind."
 agot_scenario_trp.0006.a.f:0 "You order a ship to leave on the morrow."

 agot_scenario_trp.0007.t:0 "Daughter of the Sea Snake"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.desc:0 "It does not take long for me to realize why Corlys has invited me to Driftmark. Within minutes of making land, he guides me to the garden where his daughter, the lady [laena.GetFirstName], is waiting for us. She has grown into a truly beautiful woman, and I cannot deny the effect her charms are having on me.\n\n"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.desc_betrothed:0 "Such plans have a wrinkle however. It appears if I am to have this beauty, the dragon must first slay the knight. As Corlys tells it, some years ago Laena was betrothed to [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName], who after inheriting his father's title swiftly squandered his father's legacy and now lives in Corlys's court, trying to ensure Corlys keeps his promise."
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.desc_not:0 "She was, of course, once offered to my brother when he was grieving for his first wife. But he refused, and now she is here with me, and so very #italic close#!. She was clearly a missed opportunity for him, but after trying to stand apart for so long, can I accept being second to him in marriage as I was in inheritance?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.a:0 "I shall cut this challenger down!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.a.tt:0 "If you win, you will marry [laena.GetName]"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.b:0 "My Lady, may I ask for your hand?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.b.tt:0 "You will ask for Laena's hand in marriage"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.c:0 "I'll not play second fiddle to my brother here!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0007.c.f:0 "You order the first ship home."

 agot_scenario_trp.daemon_leaves_tt:0 "You will leave the Stepstones to its own devices and return to the Red Keep."

 # 0100 - 0199: Corlys
 agot_scenario_trp.0101.t:0 "The Sea Snake"
 agot_scenario_trp.0101.desc:0 "I stand on the deck of my flagship, the Sea Snake, once again ready to set sail on another adventure for the glory of House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName]. The Triarchy's tariffs on the Stepstones have been stifling the riches I had already won, and I'll not let some upjumped merchants bring my works down at the stroke of a pen.\n\nIn this, I have made ally with [daemon.GetTitledFirstName], who has already landed on [daemon.GetCurrentLocation.GetName] and begun preparing for the next phase of the war. I shall join him, and together we shall bring the Triarchy to its knees!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0101.a:0 "To the Stepstones!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0101.a.tt:0 "Disagreeing with this war, your wife and children will not ride their dragons in this conflict"

 agot_scenario_trp.0102.t:0 "Defeat for Driftmark"
 agot_scenario_trp.0102.desc:0 "The war in the Stepstones has not gone well. The Triarchy's fleet has been too strong, and with "

 agot_scenario_trp.0102.desc.alive:0 "Daemon fleeing back to the Red Keep "
 agot_scenario_trp.0102.desc.end:0 "our chances of victory have been dashed.\n\nThe Triarchy is bound to impose even harsher tariffs on our trade, and I fear that the glory of House Velaryon may be waning for the foreseeable future."
 agot_scenario_trp.0102.a:0 "Never have I faced such defeat!"

 agot_scenario_trp.0103.t:0 "The Sea Snake's Revenge"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.desc:0 "Victory! The Triarchy's fleet is aflame, and with it their hold on the Stepstones and our trade both in ashes.\n\nI have crowned [daemon.GetFirstName] the King of the Stepstones and the Narrow Sea in a ceremony before our combined hosts, and with his assurances of free passage and port, House Velaryon is the richest in Westeros once more!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.a:0 "This alliance has proven fruitful! It should continue!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.a.daemon_t:0 "Alliance Solidified"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.a.daemon_tt:0 "Corlys has decided to continue his alliance with you"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.b:0 "The world knows that the Sea Snake is not to be trifled with!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.b.daemon_t:0 "Alliance Ended"
 agot_scenario_trp.0103.b.daemon_tt:0 "Corlys has taken his ships home, his original aims achieved"

 agot_scenario_trp.0104.t:0 "Ships in the Clear"
 agot_scenario_trp.0104.desc:0 "A solid landing has been established, and the Triarchy's fleet cannot hope to maintain their blockade of the Stepstones any longer.\n\nIf I wanted, I could sail back to Driftmark and return to my life of luxury. But I have come this far, and surely glory and gold await me if I continue on!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0104.a:0 "I shall not let this opportunity pass!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0104.b:0 "My ships can travel freely, and thus my goals are achieved."
 agot_scenario_trp.0104.b.f:0 "You will leave Daemon to fight his wars alone."

 agot_scenario_trp.0105.t:0 "An Oath Looming Large"
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.desc:0 ""It was an arrangement that made sense at the time..."\n\nMy beloved daughter, [laena.GetFirstName], has been betrothed to [laena_betrothed.GetName] for years now, but the appropriateness of the match has been on a serious decline. Shortly after I agreed to the match with the former Sealord, [laena_betrothed.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] inherited his father's position and promptly squandered his father's legacy.\n\nHis betrothal to my daughter his last remaining asset, he has been living in my court ever since, trying to ensure I keep my promise.\n\nI have been able to stave off his requests for years now, citing [laena.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] youth, but now that she is a woman grown I will not be able to maintain this charade much longer."
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.a:0 "An oath is an oath. I shall not break it."
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.a.f:0 "With a heavy heart, you assent to the marriage. Perhaps in time he will prove himself a worthy match... but you doubt it."
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.b:0 "No, the time is still not right, my apologies."
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.b.f:0 "You find more excuses to delay the marriage."
 agot_scenario_trp.0105.b.tt:0 "If Laena remains unmarried, there may be more advantageous opportunities in the future"

 agot_scenario_trp.0106.t:0 "An Ambition Renewed"
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.desc:0 "Some interesting news has passed my ears. It appears that [king.GetTitledFirstName]"
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.desc_visy:0 " is once again without a wife. Though I once sought to marry my daughter to him, she was declared too young at the time, and he instead married that Hightower harlot. Well, more's the fool him, for once again he is without a wife, and my daughter is now a woman grown.\n\nThough the insult of his previous refusal still stings, I cannot deny that the prestige of a marriage to the Iron Throne is still present, and would be a boon to my house. Perhaps I should offer my daughter's hand once more?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.desc_daemon:0 " is seeking a new wife to join him in the Red Keep.\n\nFondly do I recall our days on the Stepstones, and the glory we won together. Though I once denied a marriage to his older brother, perhaps my old friend would be more amenable to a match with my daughter now that he is King? She has grown into a fine young woman, and none could deny the appropriateness of such a match."
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.desc_other:0 " is seeking a new wife to join him in the Red Keep.\n\nThough I have sought such a match before, the time was not right. [laena.GetFirstName] was too young, even I can admit that now. Still, the wound to my pride stings, and I cannot be sure that [king.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would accept. Still, the benefits of such a match are clear."
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.desc_betrothed:0 "\n\nThere is, of course, also the matter of [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName], but in the view of a marriage to the Iron Throne he could be easily swept aside."
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.a:0 "I shall offer my daughter's hand!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.a.f:0 "You make the trip to the Red Keep to offer your daughter's hand in marriage."
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.a.tt:0 "If [king.GetTitledFirstName] accepts, he will marry [laena.GetFirstName]"
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.b:0 "I have been down this road before. I shall not offer again."
 agot_scenario_trp.0106.b.tt:0 "You will not offer your daughter's hand in marriage"

 agot_scenario_trp.0107.t:0 "Brother in Arms, Son in Law?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.desc:0 "News has reached my ear today that my old brother in arms [daemon.GetTitledFirstName] has recently found himself without a wife. Though I once sought to marry [laena.GetFirstName] to his brother, mayhaps he would be a better suitor? I have known him for many years now, and though a man of great ambition, he is a capable warrior, a dragonrider, a Targaryen, and a Prince of the realm.\n\nOf course, such a match would have to be... managed, given the strength of the spirits involved. But the benefits of it are clear. Perhaps I should invite Daemon to Driftmark, to gauge their interest in each other?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.a:0 "It cannot hurt to explore such possibilities."
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.a.f:0 "You write to Daemon, inviting him to Driftmark under the guise of a friendly visit."
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.a.landed_tt:0 "[daemon.GetFirstName] will consider your invitation."
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.a.unlanded_tt:0 "[daemon.GetFirstName] will arrive shortly."
 agot_scenario_trp.0107.b:0 "I know Daemon. Such a match is not in Laena's best interest."

 agot_scenario_trp.0108.t:0 "Badly Belayed Betrothal"
 agot_scenario_trp.0108.desc:0 "Truly, it seems that this poor match cannot be avoided.\n\n[laena.GetFirstName] has been betrothed to [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName] for over two decades now, and it is now coming to the point where her age will start to become an issue for any #italic other#! match offers she may receive. It appears that my window to find a truly opportune match has passed.\n\nI shall have to make the best of this situation, and hope that [laena_betrothed.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] can prove himself a worthy match for my daughter."
 agot_scenario_trp.0108.a:0 "Very well. I shall see this through to the end."
 agot_scenario_trp.0108.a.f:0 "You decide to keep the betrothal between Laena and [laena_betrothed.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_scenario_trp.0108.b:0 "No! I will not! This charade is over!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0108.b.f:0 "You break the betrothal between Laena and [laena_betrothed.GetFirstNameNoTooltip]."

 agot_scenario_trp.0109.t:0 "A Daughter Dilemma"
 agot_scenario_trp.0109.desc:0 "Daemon has sent word that he will not be making the trip to Driftmark, citing other matters he must attend to.\n\nDisappointing though this news is, it was far from certain they would have gotten along anyway. Still, the matter of [laena.GetFirstNamePossessive] marriage remains a pressing concern."
 agot_scenario_trp.0109.a:0 "I shall have to keep watch for other opportunities."
 agot_scenario_trp.0109.a.tt:0 "You continue to look for a match for Laena"

I thought this would be settled that very day!\n\nBut no! When he found out about the betrothal, rather than take what he wanted regardless of custom, as I had expected from the man that I knew, he completely refused! "I am done fighting men for Valyrian women's affections!" he said, whatever that could mean.\n\nIt appears that I shall have to find another match for my daughter now, and that [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName] is still finding ways to vex me!"
 agot_scenario_trp.0110.desc_not:0 "I had it all planned! [daemon.GetFirstName] would come to Driftmark, and he and [laena.GetFirstName] would be smitten, and my house would be tied to the Targaryens forever!\n\nBut no! Though sure enough he came and was happy to be wined and dined, he was cold and distant to Laena. When I broached the subject of a match between them, he was insulted by the idea!\n\nHe seemed to think I was only offering her because his brother was not available, and that I was trying to pawn her off on him! The nerve! I shall have to find another match for my daughter now, and hope that this insult does not come back to haunt me."
 agot_scenario_trp.0110.a:0 "I was so sure this would work..."

 agot_scenario_trp.0111.desc:0 "My plan worked better than I could have hoped!\n\nWhen [daemon.GetFirstName] arrived at Driftmark, he and [laena.GetFirstName] seemed to be absolutely smitten. I had thought the betrothal would prove an issue, but the rogue cut his competition down without a second thought!\n\nI saw no reason for delay, and called the septon to marry them that very day. It was a beautiful ceremony to one of the most impressive men of the realm.\n\nWhat more could a father ask for?"
 agot_scenario_trp.0111.a:0 "I am so proud!"

He and [laena.GetFirstName] seemed to be absolutely smitten, and I thought that the betrothal would be settled that very day! When he found out about the betrothal, he challenged [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName] to a duel!\n\nAstoundingly, this renowned swordsman and dragonrider was defeated by an upjumped merchant! [laena_betrothed.GetFirstName] slew him with thrust through the gut, and is demanding that Laena and he be married this very moment!"

It did not take long before he made the offer, and I was able to accept it without any issue!\n\nThe ceremony was beautiful, and the two of them seem to be very happy together. I am so proud of my daughter, and so happy that she has found such a match!"
