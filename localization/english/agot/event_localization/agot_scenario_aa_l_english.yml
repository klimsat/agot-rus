My firstborn son and heir, [breakspear.GetFirstNameNicknamed], was tragically slain by my youngest son, [maekar.GetTitledFirstName], at the Tourney of Ashford Meadow. It now falls to me to help guide [valarr.GetFirstName] — Baelor's son, and now the Prince of Dragonstone and Hand of the King — to make sure he can be a great king when I finally pass on, as his father would have been.\n\nThe Seven continue to test me and my reign, and I pray that my family can once again find stability and joy...\n\nYet, the whispers from across the sea about my brother [bittersteel.GetFirstNameNicknamed] and my nephew [daemon.GetFirstNameNicknamed] are troubling. I pray the Blackfyres do not raise their banners once more, that this uneasy peace can continue to hold, and that an old man can #bold grieve#!..."

The winds of change are sweeping across Westeros once more.\n\nIt was in times like these that my forefathers used to exploit the greenlanders and their fields and mines. I intend to follow in their footsteps and make it so the old ways are not only not forgotten, but thrive once again. We Ironborn will take what is ours, and what is ours is all that is green."

Before this tourney I was a simple knight of the hedges, but now my name is known to the house of the dragon, to lords low and high. If only I could ask Ser Arlan what to do...\n\nSer Arlan is long gone, though. It is I that remains.
