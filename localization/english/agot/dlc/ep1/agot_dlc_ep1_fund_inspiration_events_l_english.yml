#  fund_inspiration.6001.t:0 "The Dothraki Sea and saddle gallop through my heart,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6001.desc:1 "I have been riding for months on end. My rear shall never recover! I've acquired quite the taste for fermented mare's milk and nights beneath the open sky.\n\nWith this courier, I send a gift from the khalasar — a decorative horse head to be placed atop instruments. Perhaps you have a use for it."
#  fund_inspiration.6001.a:0 "I'll hold onto this!"
#  fund_inspiration.6001.b:0 "Send it to the Court Musician."

# #India

#  fund_inspiration.6002.t:0 "My jaunt along the Rhoyne moves onward,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6002.desc:0 "I am near-blinded by all the gems the courts I visit have to show me. I find myself yearning for the filth of the open river.\n\nI have sent a courier with a particularly tasteless gift I was given — a tiger's head ornament on a ring, with jewels for eyes. Have you ever seen something so garish?"
#  fund_inspiration.6002.a:0 "I rather like it, it's his loss."
#  fund_inspiration.6002.b:0 "Ghastly! Take it apart and sell the gems."

#  fund_inspiration.6003.desc:0 "My liege, my journey to the Disputed Lands is underway, and I have joined a company traversing the width of the land.\n\nI send to you a piece of jewelry one of my fellow travelers granted me — a most delicate necklace covered in ostrich shell beads. I suppose you haven't seen an ostrich."
#  fund_inspiration.6003.a:0 "A fine find! I will wear it myself."
#  fund_inspiration.6003.b:1 "I shall give it to [event_spouse.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."

#  fund_inspiration.6004.t:0 "Ah, the old Empire of Ghis,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6004.desc:0 "My journey through Slaver's Bay has mostly involved fighting off hoards of peddlers on the streets.\n\nOft, in order not to delay my quest over-long, I give in and buy one of their little trinkets. I have sent a courier bearing the tat your way. Perhaps it shall provide some amusement."
#  fund_inspiration.6004.a:0 "What use is an adventurer who takes the common path?"
#  fund_inspiration.6004.b:0 "These are some pretty baubles..."

# #Europe

#  fund_inspiration.6005.t:0 "My adventures are sodden,"
#  #AGOT Modified
#  fund_inspiration.6005.desc:0 "My Lord, I have found a few trite relics so far in my adventures, which I have sent with this courier, but I am unsure what I may uncover next.\n\nThe Free Cities are home to the smelliest creatures I have encountered. As a child, I dreamt of the green and pleasant meadows, but I am convinced half of this world is made of mud. If you are a gracious liege, please send word to call me back."
#  fund_inspiration.6005.a:0 "This isn't a holiday! Quest on!"
#  fund_inspiration.6005.b:0 "Poor soul, I suppose these rewards shall suffice."
#  fund_inspiration.6005.b.tt:0 "You permit [inspiration_owner.GetTitledFirstName] to return home"

#  fund_inspiration.6006.desc:0 "My travels to the far edge of the known world have left me with quite a taste for lamb, yogurt and eggplants, and I have sent some recipes along with this courier.\n\nI have been given a golden brooch adorned with a seahorse by one of my hosts, which I also send to you. I'm certain my travels will bring further wonders in due time."
#  fund_inspiration.6006.a:0 "Order our chefs to prepare these dishes at once!"
#  fund_inspiration.6006.b:0 "[inspiration_owner.GetSheHe|U] seems to be having too much fun on this quest..."

 #Artifact Descriptions
 fund_inspiration.1051.desc.epic.valyrian_steel:0 "lies a Valyrian steel blade — both a relic of a long-gone empire and a most deadly weapon of extraordinary quality.\n\nSaid to be forged in dragonfire, rippling patterns flow through its dark blade as if trapped by ancient magic.\n\nI wonder to whom it may have belonged in the past, but it makes no difference — such an invaluable possession will bring glory to the [ROOT.Char.GetDynasty.GetNameNoTooltip] dynasty forevermore!"
 fund_inspiration.1051.desc.epic.dragon_egg:0 "rests a dragon egg. Could it be?\n\n[inspiration_owner.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] smiles proudly: "[epic.GetDesc]""
 fund_inspiration.1051.desc.epic.redbeard_axe:0 "lies the axe of Raymun Redbeard, the King-Beyond-the-Wall who brought his savage host south and faced the lords of the North in the battle at Long Lake. \n\nIt is unknown whether it was Redbeard's axe that lopped William Stark's head off, but examining this hefty, yet expertly balanced weapon, much sharper than what I considered possible in a bronze blade, I have no doubts that it was a suitable tool for the job."
 fund_inspiration.1051.desc.epic.skinchangers_second_pelt:0 "I see a pelt of a furry predator, unremarkable in any respect besides the unusual amount of punctures and cuts suggesting a far more labored kill than what is expected from an expert hunter. \n\nStill, running my hand across the fur evokes such a strong sensation of uneasy excitement that I feel it would be palpable even without knowing that this skin was taken off a human being."
 fund_inspiration.1051.desc.epic.giants_tooth:0 "there is a gargantuan tooth. It is almost comical how immediately this one feature of prodigious size distinguishes the finding as something special. \n\nThe giant tooth is, in fact, a tooth of a giant, there are no two ways about it."
