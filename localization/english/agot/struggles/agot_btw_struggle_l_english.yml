 game_concept_btw_struggle_desc:2 "The $game_concept_btw_struggle$ depicts the millenia of fractious relationships beyond the wall. Though born of the construction of the Wall eight thousand of years ago at the end of the Long Night, the [struggle|E] shifts between [struggle_phase_phases|E] of hate-fueled violence, wary truces, and pragmatic cooperation. There are few permanent allies in such a situation, and [rulers|E] should be wary of relying purely on a shared [faith|E] or [culture|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_btw_opportunity:1 "Opportunity Phase"
 game_concept_struggle_phase_btw_opportunity_desc:2 "After a long period of relatively peaceful coexistence during the [struggle_phase_btw_conciliation|E], complacency begins to set in. Everyone is comfortable that things just #EMP work#!, allowing more shrewd [characters|E] to take advantage of their naivety.\n\nEventually, fresh abuses will either cause an escalation into the [struggle_phase_btw_hostility|E], or else savvy politicking reaches an uneasy equilibrium through the [struggle_phase_btw_conciliation|E]."

Repeated acts of malice and escalated misunderstandings during  the [struggle_phase_btw_opportunity|E] have lead to rising hatred of [characters|E] with differing [cultures|E].\n\nSuch bloodshed cannot persist forever, though. Eventually, either cooler heads or simple exhaustion bring the lands beyond the wall to the [struggle_phase_btw_compromise|E]."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_btw_compromise_desc:2 "Whether through sickness with the strife of the [struggle_phase_btw_hostility|E] or deft escalation during the [struggle_phase_btw_conciliation|E], the $game_concept_struggle_phase_btw_compromise$ represents a growing accommodation between the Wildlings. Differences fall by the wayside and shared history and heritage binds former foes together.\n\nThe lands beyond the wall stand at a cross-roads: if conflicts reappear, then the [struggle_phase_btw_opportunity|E] awaits."

 game_concept_struggle_phase_btw_conciliation_desc: "The product of a notable [struggle_phase_btw_compromise|E], during this $game_concept_struggle_phase_phase$, relations between the Wildlings grow so cordial that outsiders find their permissiveness difficult to parse.\n\nThis can't last forever, though, and abuses of trust will eventually bring the [btw_struggle|E] back around to the [struggle_phase_btw_compromise|E]."
