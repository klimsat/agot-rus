 agot_bm_6583:0 "The Fall of the Greyirons"
 agot_bm_6583_desc:0 "A thousand years after their landing on the Fingers, the Andals have turned their attention to the Iron Islands. As the Andals invaded and settled in the riverlands, westerlands, and the Reach, they began constructing new settlements and stout castles. These stronger defenses, combined with the Andals' sailing ability, have weakened the grip of the Ironborn on the Sunset Sea. The Andals have begun to invade the Iron Islands in waves, often with the support of rival Ironborn lords. Now Rognar II Greyiron, King of the Iron Islands, must face an alliance of Andals with Houses Drumm, Greyjoy, Hoare, and Orkwood."

Ironborn raid the west coasts, Andals emboldened by their victories in the south have been known to make landfall on the east coasts and the threat of the Wildlings beyond the Wall can never be discounted. Elsewhere in Westeros the First Men continue to struggle against the seemingly endless tide of Andal invaders."

 agot_bm_6699_desc:0 "With the fighting largely over and the greatest heroes all defeated, the wisest of the First Men realized that resisting the tide of invaders was not possible. Many of them also saw their way to adopting the worship of the Andal's seven gods. What will the future hold for Westeros in this new age?"
