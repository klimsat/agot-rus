 bookmark_106_jeyne_arryn_desc:0 "Lady Jeyne Arryn inherited the Vale at the tender age of three. Neither her youth nor her gender has inspired much confidence among her vassals, while ambitious male relatives bide their time, eager for any chance to overthrow her. #bold Will she survive the challenges of her regency and cling to her lofty throne?#!"

 bookmark_239_steffon_tully_desc:0 "With Prince Duncan’s reckless marriage and subsequent disinheritance, House Tully has stumbled upon a rare prize: Young Celia’s engagement to Prince Jaehaerys will make her queen someday. #bold That is, as long as as Lord Steffon Tully can ensure the betrothal lasts...#!"

 bookmark_258_tancred_crane:0 "Lord Tancred"
 bookmark_258_tancred_crane_desc:0 "The son of a Targaryen princess, Lord Tancred Crane commands a level of prestige and influence that far exceeds what his title alone would afford. Forsooth, he has been honored with a personal invitation from the king to attend a grand celebration at Summerhall to celebrate the next generation of Targaryens. #bold What bright future lies in store for those who gather there?#!"

 #bookmark_106_rhaenyra_targaryen:0 "Princess Rhaenyra" # already exists
 bookmark_106_rhaenyra_targaryen_desc:0 "Only the unfortunate deaths of a near half-dozen relatives have led Rhaenyra Targaryen to be named Princess of Dragonstone — yet her position hangs in precarity. The Hand of the King and his allies are using the new queen to undermine ‘the Realm’s Delight,’ scheming to place one of Hightower blood upon the Iron Throne. #bold Sinister forces at court may try to upend her birthright, but can Rhaenyra secure the succession a build a new order?#!"

 bookmark_209_danelle_lothston:0 "‘Mad’ Danelle"
 bookmark_209_danelle_lothston_desc:0 "The Curse of Harrenhal weighs heavy on all who pass through the castle’s crumbling gates, but none bear it greater than ‘Mad’ Danelle Lothston. Countless accidents and betrayals have all but eradicated her family — making her a ruler in her youth, and some say driving her insane. #bold Servants speak of magic rituals and giant bats in the moonlit sky; rumors flow over feasts of flesh and baths filled with blood. Are the tales true?#!"

 bookmark_209_viserys_plumm:0 "Lord Viserys"
 bookmark_209_viserys_plumm_desc:0 "Wars are waged when bastards claim lands from false fathers, but not for Viserys Plumm. Whatever doubts were put aside by the lack of another acceptable heir — and not wanting to incur the wrath of Aegon ‘the Unworthy.’ Having settled into his life as a lord, Viserys has shown little ambition for the throne and enjoys the life of a country lord. #bold But what of the generation of disguised dragons that will follow him? Could Viserys shed his purple charade and claim the mantle of red and black?#!"

 bookmark_239_gerold_lannister:0 "Lord Gerold"
 bookmark_239_gerold_lannister_desc:0 "A thousand rumors surround Gerold ‘the Golden.’ His rule of the West may have brought great prosperity, but the smallfolk whisper he killed his brother, niece, and two wives as soon as they stood in his way. Now two of his sons have fallen fighting enemies of the crown; a marriage pact with House Reyne seemingly shattered by a Blackfyre blade. Yet Ellyn Reyne is not one to let death stand in her way. #bold Can House Lannister usher in another generation of prosperity, or might a weak-willed cub destroy all Gerold has built?#!"

 bookmark_258_aemon_tarth:0 "Lord Aemon"
 bookmark_258_aemon_tarth_desc:0 "What do you get as a result of the sins of a peasant from Flea Bottom and a princess from upon high? A quiet lord trying to enjoy his days upon the Sapphire Isle. Wedded to his cousin to avoid any question of his succession, Lord Aemon faces no rebellion. #bold But another of baseborn dragonblood gathers a host across the Narrow Sea; can Aemon keep the secret of his birth and safeguard Tarth from the one they call ‘the Monstrous’?#!"

 bookmark_277_loreza_martell:0 "Princess Loreza"
 bookmark_277_loreza_martell_desc:0 "The king is in shackles, yet the Prince of Dragonstone remains without a betrothal. Perhaps the strapping Prince Rhaegar could be convinced to take a Princess of Dorne to bride, strengthening the long-standing ties between the Iron Throne and its southernmost subjects. #bold As the realm holds its breath, can Princess Loreza Martell negotiate a betrothal between her daughter Elia and the heir-apparent?#!"

 bookmark_277_beric_dayne:0 "Lord Beric"
 bookmark_277_beric_dayne_desc:0 "Life is good for Lord Beric Dayne: An elder son and heir ready to carry on the lineage, a younger son counted among the greatest knights in the realm, a beautiful daughter coming of age, and a loving wife at his side. Though news of a Defiance at Duskendale mars the scene, a falling star may yet again prove fruitful to House Dayne. #bold With Prince Rhaegar Targaryen yet unwed, might the stewards of Starfall secure a betrothal to the future king?#!"

 bookmark_282_walter_whent:0 "Lord Walter"
 bookmark_282_walter_whent_desc:0 "How much has changed since that fateful tourney... Lord Walter Whent, known for being as open-handed as he is wealthy, played host to one of the most pivotal moments of Harrenhal’s history: The tournament that tore the realm asunder. Prince Rhaegar’s victory, and crowning of Lyanna Stark as Queen of Love and Beauty, sparked this damned war — and the division it has fomented. #bold As the realm readies for war, Walter must choose between his goodbrother and liege, Lord Hoster Tully, and his own brother and Kingsguard, Ser Oswell Whent.#!"

 bookmark_282_walder_frey:0 "Lord Walder"
 bookmark_282_walder_frey_desc:0 "Few in the Seven Kingdoms have had so long a rule as Lord Walder Frey, and fewer still have as long a memory for any wrongs against one’s family. As war rages across the land, the alliances on either side seem little but a trite accounting for lords who have long traded marriages amongst themselves — spurning undesireable houses at any turn. #bold Some call chaos a ladder, but Walder sees it as a bridge... to a better life for House Frey and his many, #italic many#! children.#!"

 bookmark_284_jon_arryn_desc:0 "Winning a war is one thing. Ruling a realm, quite the other. Now that King Robert Baratheon, First of His Name, sits the Iron Throne, he has tapped his mentor and friend Lord Jon Arryn to help him ensure peace and prosperity as Hand of the King. #bold With a young, #italic surely#! trustworthy Tully bride at his side, can Jon both secure the Seven Kingdoms and his own succession in the Vale from his new post in King’s Landing?#!"

 bookmark_284_petyr_baelish:0 "Lord Petyr ‘Littlefinger’"
 bookmark_284_petyr_baelish_desc:0 "Always keep your foes confused. If they are never certain who you are or what you want, they cannot know what you are like to do next. Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose, or even seem to work against you. #bold Remember that when you come to play the only game... the #italic game of thrones#!!#!"
