Robert I Baratheon now sits upon the Iron Throne of Westeros, but he soon realizes that being a king is not so easy as he had expected.\n\n“Honor? I’ve got Seven Kingdoms to rule! One King, Seven Kingdoms! Do you think honor keeps them in line? Do you think it’s honor that’s keeping the peace?  #bold It’s fear! Fear and blood!#!”"
