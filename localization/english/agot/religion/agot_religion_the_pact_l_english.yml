### Faiths ###
#Northern Old Gods
 old_gods_wnw:0 "Old Gods of Winter and Wood"
 old_gods_wnw_adj:0 "Old Gods"
 old_gods_wnw_adherent:0 "Old Gods Follower"
 old_gods_wnw_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"
 old_gods_wnw_desc:0 "Adopted after the Pact, the worship of the Old Gods has persisted in the North more than in any other part of the Seven Kingdoms. The worship of the Old Gods is a simple one, much more personal than that of the Faith of the Seven — there are few commandments and no scriptures. How one honors the gods is a personal matter. The key tenets are the sacredness of the weirwoods, the sanctity of guest right, and the holiness of oaths sworn before the heart tree."

#River Old Gods
 old_gods_rnh:0 "Old Gods of Rivers and Hills"
 old_gods_rnh_adj:0 "River Old Gods"
 old_gods_rnh_adherent:0 "Old Gods Follower"
 old_gods_rnh_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"
 old_gods_rnh_desc:0 "Outside of the North, the next greatest bastion of the worship of the Old Gods is the Riverlands. Even before the revival, as men from the North settled here, key houses kept the worship. Their practice differs from their northern neighbors, melding with the Faith of the Seven to the south. In addition to the sacredness of the weirwoods and guest right, these people have adopted knighthoods — whose oaths are sworn not in a sept, but before the heart tree."

 old_gods_mnv_adj:0 "Vale Old Gods"
 old_gods_mnv_adherent:0 "Old Gods Follower"

 old_gods_mnv_desc:0 "Though the Vale and Mountains of the Moon were the first to be conquered by the Andals and the first place where the Faith of the Seven took root in Westeros, there are still old and strong ties to the First Men and their beliefs. As such, the region has seen a return to the worship of the Old Gods, while still maintaining many of the traditions and rights that the people of the Vale knew as the Faithful."

 old_gods_rng_adherent:0 "Old Gods Follower"
 old_gods_rng_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"
 old_gods_rng_desc:0 "The Westerlands has long been a sacred place for the worship of the Old Gods. It was here that Corlos showed mercy upon the lion cubs and was rewarded by the Old Gods.

 old_gods_fng_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"
 old_gods_fng_desc:0 "The Reach was the home of the Faith of the Seven for most of its history, yet it still maintains ties to the Old Gods. Tales of Garth Greenhand, the Living Throne of the Oakenseat, the Skinchangers by the Red Lake, and others, persist. These ties have been wholly embraced with the return of the worship of the Old Gods, although the influence of the Faith can still be seen in some of the tenets and traditions practiced in the Reach."

 old_gods_snw_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"
 old_gods_snw_desc:0 "The Stormlands have long maintained their ties to the Children of the Forest, famously allying to fight against the Holy Brotherhood. These ties have led to a resurgence in the worship of the Old Gods in the region, while still maintaining some of the traditions the smallfolk and greatfolk adopted under the Faith."

 old_gods_dns_adherent_plural:0 "Old Gods Followers"

 old_gods_btw_sni_desc:0 "Worship of the Old Gods is strong in the frozen places beyond the Wall.
