 unknown_generic:0 "The world is wide, and much of it lies beyond the understanding or concern of those bound to their own corners of it. Though maps may show distant shores and whispered lands, such places are far removed from the reach of lords and kings, and further still from the affairs that shape the known realms. What lies beyond is not ours to know. The focus remains on what is near, what can be ruled and recorded. All else, for now, lies beyond the edges of relevance, untouched and unheeded."
