 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0001.desc: "[daemon.GetTitledFirstName] has pressed his claim to the Throne. The time is nigh; we must join forces once more and lay waste to the Targaryens and their lickspittle lords. A long winter, a foolish king, and discontented lords make Westeros ripe for the taking. Victory is within our grasp this time — I can feel it.\n\nTo battle!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0001.a: "Beneath the Gold, the Bitter Steel!"

#Aegor Rivers (We have won the war! I'll ask for a reward for my loyal service)

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0002.desc: "[daemon.GetTitledFirstName] has at last won the throne! Weeks have passed since that glorious day, and things have begun to settle down...\n\nThe new king now has need of loyal servants — advisers to help guide His Grace in the ways of Westeros. Given my role in his ascension, I could potentially request a role for myself.\n\nOr perhaps a simple reward would suffice."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0002.a: "The Hand of the King would prove a suitable position."

#Daemon Becomes King!
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0010.t: "A Blackfyre Victory"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0010.desc: "It can scarcely be believed...\n\nFor generations, my forefathers have endured hardship, exile, and mockery. House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] has warred and schemed, has bled and died, all for one single dream, one single purpose: reclaiming our birthright, our righteous place upon the Iron Throne. Today, this dream becomes reality.\n\nAs I climb the steps to the Iron Throne, my mind turns to my namesake. Tears fill my eyes as I turn to face the throne room. #italic If only you could see me now, grandfather...#!\n\nIt has taken many years, but at last, a Daemon of House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip] sits upon the Iron Throne. I am but a seed for a dynasty that shall last a thousand years and more!"

#Daemon III (The Invasion)
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0011.t: "The Invasion!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0011.desc: "My heart pounds with a mixture of excitement and fear as I ready my forces for our western invasion — one final bid for my birthright.\n\nWesteros will bleed; that much is certain, but it will bleed for a noble cause. [GetScriptedCharacterByHistoryID('Targaryen_88').GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveRegnal] intentions for my grandfather were clear: by bestowing [blackfyre.GetName] upon him, he marked him as his rightful heir. Any and all Targaryen kings that followed were nothing but undeserving usurpers.\n\n#bold The realm will bow before its rightful King!#!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0011.a: "I smell victory..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0011.a.tt: "Only a handful of traditional [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip] loyalists have rallied to our cause. Should I prove that my rebellion may yet succeed where others had failed by holding my own against the might of the Iron Throne, more may join us in our righteous fight. Perhaps I could even tip the scales with a convenient death..."

#Daemon Lands in Westeros (Realm Notification Event)
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0012.t: "Another Blackfyre Rebellion"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0012.desc: "Grave news for the realm: [daemon.GetTitledFirstNameRegnal], a long-forgotten scion of the treacherous House [daemon.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip], has landed in Westeros! He commands a host of thousands, led by [aegor.GetTitledFirstName]. Just as the wounds of the realm were thought to be healing, the Seven Kingdoms are once again at war.\n\nWith the realm in turmoil once more, a choice must now be made."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0012.a: "To arms! This black dragon must be quashed."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0012.b: "Perhaps this could be advantageous..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0012.c: "Perhaps I should join this black dragon?"

#Daemon Blackfyre Alliances are Called in (One Year Later)
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0013.t: "A Year of Rebellion"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0013.desc: "A year has passed since I declared for the Throne. It seems the longer we last, the longer I remain alive in defiance of the so-called [aegonv.GetTitledFirstName], the more lords flock to our banner. Many among the Blackfyre loyalists of old, who once rallied to my ancestors' causes, have now declared for me.\n\nIt remains to be seen whether their renewed support will tip the scales of conflict."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0013.a: "A second wind in our sails!"

# Daemon Blackfyre Alliances are Called in (After Killing Duncan Tall in Duel)
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0014.t: "My Courageous Victory"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0014.desc: "It can scarcely be believed, and yet it is true. I have slain [aegonv.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] fiercest protector, [duncantall.GetNameNicknamed]. Such an achievement appears to have inspired some of the more hesitant lords.\n\nHaving done the unthinkable, many among the Blackfyre loyalists of old, who once rallied to my ancestor's cause, have now declared for me."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0014.a: "I cannot be defeated!"

# Daemon Blackfyre: Response to Aegor's Request
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.t: "A Bitter Request"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.desc: "Weeks have passed since my victory, my ascension to the Iron Throne. In these weeks I have not been idle. Days and nights I have spent consolidating my power, making certain House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName]'s grasp upon the Throne is secure for years to come.\n\nNow, as I rest upon the Throne, basking in the glory of my work, [aegor.GetFirstName] comes to me with a request...\n\n"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.gold: "A humble 1000 gold for my efforts in securing our victory. My men are tired, but we shall continue to serve you whatever may come.\n\nWe ask only for a small sum for our efforts. With gold, there is plenty of glory to go around to celebrate your rise!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.hotk: "My liege, it has been an honor serving your righteous cause. With the throne now seated by its one true king, I humbly ask to be named your Hand. Allow me to continue to serve and provide my wisdom to your rule, until the end of my days."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.summerhall: "With our victory, the Golden Company will now disband. We have completed our one and only purpose of restoring our rightful liege to his throne. I humbly ask now for a place to settle, a place where I may serve you faithfully as a lord."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.lc: "My liege, it has been an honor fighting under your banners. With the throne now seated by its one true king, I humbly ask that you allow me to pledge my life to keep you safe from all harm. The Kingsguard, as it stands, has served the wrong house, the wrong king, and they cannot be trusted with Your Grace.\n\nI will take the initiative. Name me your Lord Commander, and I shall make certain your dynasty will last a thousand years!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.gc_tt: "You receive the Golden Company army as [special_troops|E]."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.a: "A reasonable petition; I shall grant it."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.0015.b: "It saddens me to say, but no..."

#Daemon III Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.t: "A Fourth Rebellion?"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.desc: "With winter at an end, the time is ripe for another invasion. Like my father before me, and his father before him, I stand at the helm of a great host. With Bittersteel and the Golden Company at my side, we shall make a mighty force. But the work is far from over.\n\nThe realm thinks us done, as tattered as our banners, but we may yet show these plump high lords that House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] can still wield the strength and influence needed to rule the Seven Kingdoms. We must reach across the Narrow Sea, sway some of the local forces to our cause, and tear [aegonv.GetHouse.GetName] rule from within.\n\nThe shameful betrayal of the Great Council must not be forgotten. I will claim what is mine by right or die trying. House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip] will sit upon the Iron Throne!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.a: "I will invade!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.a.tt: "#EMP You will start your invasion exactly two weeks from now.#!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.b: "On second thought..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1000.b.tt: "#EMP You set your hopes for an invasion aside for now.#!"

#Aegor Rivers Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1001.t: "Beneath the Gold, the Bitter Steel"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1001.desc: "The crown I placed upon [daemon.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveRegnal] head leaves only one path forward. Now that winter has ended at last, an opportunity for another bid for the Throne presents itself.\n\nThe bitter taste of our last attempt still lingers in my mouth. As I grow older, my desperation to place a [daemon.GetHouse.GetName] upon the Throne rises with every passing year. And yet, now that the wretched Bloodraven has been so foolishly removed by the King, our chances have never been better.\n\nThe Golden Company will sharpen our swords. We are not done yet. My dear brother [daemoni.GetFirstName], we are going home at last!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1001.desc.b: "My years in exile now comprise most of my life. Time after time, rebellion after rebellion, we have crossed the Narrow Sea in the hopes of returning to our homeland and placing a [daemon.GetHouse.GetName] upon the Iron Throne. Time after time, we have failed.\n\nThe bitter taste of our last attempt still lingers in my mouth. As I grow older, my desperation to place a [daemon.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip] upon the Throne rises with every passing year. And yet, now that the wretched Bloodraven has been so foolishly removed by the King, an opportunity for another bid for the Throne presents itself.\n\nPerhaps it is not too late..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1001.a: "Ready your swords, men!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1001.a.b: "What shall we do?"

#Aegon V Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1002.t: "An Unlikely Reign"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1002.desc: "Three years have passed since my ascension to the Iron Throne, and the harsh winter that shadowed it is no more. Born the fourth son of a fourth son, I had never imagined I would find myself in this unenviable position. Nevertheless, I have used my newfound powers to benefit the downtrodden, the weak, and the less fortunate — a move that stirred some disagreement amongst my more traditional lords.\n\nNow murmurs from the east have reached my ears. A [daemon.GetHouse.GetName] pretender, the so-called [daemon.GetTitledFirstName], is gathering forces for an invasion. Another attempt to seize the Iron Throne from its rightful ruler.\n\nI must make alliances and build bridges with my discontent lords if [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName]'s rule is to survive this coming storm. Gods give me strength..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1002.a: "Perhaps Bloodraven was right..."

#Duncan the Small Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1003.t: "The Prince of Dragonflies"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1003.desc: "The sun rises in the east behind the Dragonmont, casting its long shade over Dragonstone. Once more, I find myself in awe of this castle and the heavy burden its lordship presents. I did not choose this fate. It was inflicted upon me by the gods and my father, [aegonv.GetFirstName].\n\nNow, with a new [daemon.GetHouse.GetName] host assembling in Tyrosh, my father is considering betrothing me to some lord's daughter — to cement an alliance that would withstand the coming onslaught from the east.\n\nTo say that I am not enthused would be an understatement. I am not even a man grown, and yet my lord father would have me decide whom I wish to share a bed with for the rest of my life — though he himself married later in life, and for love. The injustice of it makes me writhe with frustration. And yet, a good king knows the realm must come first. I am conflicted."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1003.a: "The gods are cruel!"

#Gerold Lannister Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1004.t: "The Golden Lion"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1004.desc: "Lord Gerold 'the Golden,' they once called me. I was a shrewd and able lord. My rule, prosperous and fair. To get here, I have had to commit many distasteful acts over the years — acts which leave me shamed and fearful. Yet to keep the tree alive and well, some weeds must be plucked to benefit House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetName] and the Westerlands.\n\nYet for my ambitions, the gods saw fit to punish me. First, they took my wife, then my beloved son and heir. My grief, age, and illness have left me unable to pull upon the reins of lordship as I once had. Now, I spend most days in my bedchamber with my books, while my court is infested with a different kind of Reynes. And war is brewing across the Narrow Sea.\n\nPerhaps my punishment is not unjust..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1004.a: "Will the realm hear me roar once more?"

#Lyonel Baratheon Intro Event
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1005.t: "The Laughing Storm"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1005.desc: "Another tempestuous night washes over Storm's End, perhaps forecasting a coming storm of a different sort. A [daemon.GetHouse.GetName] pretender in the east — these do grow ever so common nowadays — has risen to claim the Iron Throne. When will these false dragons learn their place?\n\nRumors have reached my ears that my liege, [aegonv.GetTitledFirstName], seeks to wed my beloved daughter [cassandra.GetFirstName] to his son and heir, [duncansmall.GetTitledFirstNameNicknamed]. A wise choice, I say! The betrothal will likely be cemented in the coming months.\n\nNow, I must sharpen my sword and ready my lords for the battles to come. My domain is like to be the place of landing for the Blackfyre Host, and I, for one, cannot wait to meet [daemon.GetTitledFirstName] in the flesh."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1005.a: "Oh, how I've missed the sound of war horns!"

### 1010 - 1019 # AegonV Events
#Aegon POV

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1010.desc: "The next Blackfyre invasion is looming ever closer. [ROOT.Char.GetPrimarySpouse.GetFirstName] has suggested a potential alliance with [lyonel.GetTitledFirstName] to help protect our house in the coming war. If my son [duncansmall.GetFirstName] is willing to wed [lyonel.GetTitledFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] daughter, [cassandra.GetFirstName], when she comes of age, the match could prove extremely valuable.\n\nFirst, I must find out whether [duncansmall.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] would agree to the match. Only then should I contact [lyonel.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1010.a: "Send the ravens!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1010.b: "I don't need his help..."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1011.t: "Refusal"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1011.desc: "My son [duncansmall.GetFirstName] has refused to betroth [cassandra.GetFirstName]... I cannot say that I am surprised, though I am disappointed. [duncansmall.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] has always had his own way of doing things, even when it comes at the expense of House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip]'s interests…"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1011.a: "There is no hope for this one..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1011.a.tt: "[duncansmall.GetShortUINamePossessive] refusal will allow you to disinherit him."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1012.t: "Acceptance!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1012.desc: "My son [duncansmall.GetFirstName] has agreed to betroth [cassandra.GetFirstName]... The greatest hurdle is behind us, I am certain. [duncansmall.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] is the more capricious of the two. Now we must see whether [lyonel.GetFirstName] will agree to the match."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1012.a: "Surely the Stag will agree?"

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1013.t: "The Stag's Response"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1013.desc.a: "I am overjoyed. [lyonel.GetTitledFirstName] has agreed to betroth his daughter [cassandra.GetFirstName] to my son [duncansmall.GetFirstName]. With [duncansmall.GetFirstNamePossessiveNoTooltip] approval, the alliance is cemented. Our future seems brighter now. We shall face the coming storm... with a laughing one."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1013.desc.r: "[lyonel.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] answer came this morning, and it was not what I had hoped...\n\nHe has refused to betroth [cassandra.GetFirstName] to my son [duncansmall.GetFirstName],úss even with [duncansmall.GetFirstNameNoTooltip] himself agreeing to the match. Perhaps I underestimated my lords' frustration with my reforms...\n\nA new match must be found for [duncansmall.GetTitledFirstNameNoTooltip]. Our time grows short!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1013.a.a: "Exactly as planned."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1013.a.r: "Such a shame..."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1014.t: "The Prince of Dragonflies"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1014.desc: "My son [duncansmall.GetFirstName] has abdicated! My disappointment in him was no secret, but I did not expect him to resort to such drastic actions...\n\nLittle more than a common beggar, he now follows the road, having relinquished his lands and titles to [jaehaerys.GetTitledFirstName]..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1014.a: "There #italic really#! is no hope for this one..."

### 1020 - 1029 # Duncan Events
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.t: "A Parental Request"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.desc: "A raven has arrived from my father in the capital. He wishes me to wed [lyonel.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] daughter, [cassandra.GetFirstName], when she comes of age. I cannot say I did not expect this, displeased as I am. I am not ready for marriage; that much is clear to me.\n\nAnd yet, the stability and good of the realm must be considered. Alliances must be made if we are to survive the next Blackfyre Rebellion..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.a: "I agree to this, for the good of the realm!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.a.tt: "This alliance offer will only proceed if [lyonel.GetFirstName] also agrees to the match."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.b: "I-I don't want to!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1020.b.tt: "If you refuse, [aegonv.GetFirstName] can #EMP disinherit#! you without consequence."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1021.t: "Disappointment"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1021.desc: "In the end, I could not do it. I have refused my father's wishes to betroth [cassandra.GetFirstName]...\n\nHis response will surely be disapproving silence. It is no surprise that he is upset with me. But I will not tie my life to a woman I do not know for the sake of an alliance. Father must understand this, in the depths of his heart."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1021.a: "I... I did what I had to do!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1021.b: "Perhaps my father did have my best interests at heart..."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1022.t: "Freedom, For Now"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1022.desc: "Joyous — though unexpected — news! [lyonel.GetTitledFirstName] has refused my father's offer to betroth me to his daughter [cassandra.GetFirstName]...\n\nI must say I did not see this coming. Though I cannot complain, of course. [aegonv.GetTitledFirstName|U] will surely be disappointed, perhaps even aggrieved, but I doubt the realm will suffer for this. Though he may try to find another match for me in the coming years, there is no doubt his ambitions were tempered by this refusal. I may yet have more time..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1022.a: "I certainly don't object!"

This could prove a rare opportunity. Wedding into the royal family, after all, would bring immense influence over the running of the realm.\n\nStill, this means my support will be expected in the face of any... external threats.\n\nI must weigh my options carefully."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1030.a: "Let [aegonv.GetTitledFirstName] know that I agree!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1030.a.tt: "You accept the proposal."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1030.a.notification: "[lyonel.GetFirstName] accepts the proposal."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1031.t: "A Royal Refusal"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1031.desc: "It seems my hopes of a royal engagement were for naught. That foolish brat [duncansmall.GetTitledFirstName] has seemingly refused a betrothal to my sweet daughter [cassandra.GetFirstName], claiming he 'wishes to marry for love, not politics.'\n\nThough these are only whispers, and there were no official offers, I cannot hide my disappointment. A lady of House [ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetNameNoTooltip] does not, it seems, make a fit match for this prince."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.1031.a: "Seven help us all when this royal spawn sits the throne..."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9990.desc: "War is a bloody business; that much I have known for years. Yet nothing could have prepared me for the carnage I now wade through. A red shower of entrails and gore washes over me as I drive my sword through another dying foe's horse.\n\nI wipe the blood from my visor, and then I see him — towering over my soldiers and swinging a mighty greatsword. Before I can turn away, he spots me, shoving a fully armored knight aside with a force that could fell a grown destrier.\n\nGods be good, he is headed straight toward me..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9990.a: "[ROOT.Char.GetHouse.GetMotto]"

#Tall POV
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9991.t: "The Wall and the Dragon"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9991.desc: "Another war, another rebellion. I smash through the enemy line with relative ease, splitting Blackfyre soldiers in half with my greatsword. Though my strength has waned with age in recent years, it is good to know I am still thrice as strong as the average soldier.\n\nSuddenly, from beyond the red mist of battle, I see him — the so-called [daemon.GetTitledFirstName], gutting a horse from beneath its rider. I could end this rebellion today with one great swing of my sword..."
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9991.a: "For the King!"

#Aegor POV
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9994.t: "The Lion Cub"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9994.desc: "I slash and smash through the enemy line. Foe after foe falls before me as I make Blackfyre dance upon the battlefield. [aegonv.GetTitledFirstNamePossessive] dogs swing and miss, or their swords clang uselessly against my armor. No blade nor mace is a match for my Valyrian steel.\n\nI swing once more — and Blackfyre clashes against a ruby-encrusted longsword. Beneath it, smiling insolently, stands a golden-haired youth."

 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9995.desc: "I hack, slash, and cut down one black dragon after another. These rebellious fools will soon be driven back into the sea from which they came. I spy the so-called [daemon.GetTitledFirstName] across the battlefield, too far to reach. If only he were closer...\n\nA flash of black-veined steel catches my eye. The aging Bittersteel is carving a bloody path through our line. I must seize this chance at eternal glory!"
 agot_fourth_blackfyre_rebellion.9995.a: "I may yet be a legend!"
